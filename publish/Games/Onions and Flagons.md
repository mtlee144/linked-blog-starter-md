An interesting game made by '[[Acquisitions Incorporated#Lizards of the Coast|Lizards of the Coast]]' from the [[Acquisitions Incorporated]]. It involves several people at a table pretending to be fantastical characters, explaining what they want that character to do, and then rolling dice to determine its effectiveness.

Those who have played it are incredibly invested and love to have others join. Unfortunately the time investment per 'session' and scheduling issues have caused the game to not take off as it should have.
