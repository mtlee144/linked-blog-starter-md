#Worldbuilding 

A fun game for 2 people created by a franchise known as '[[Acquisitions Incorporated#Lizards of the Coast|Lizards of the Coast]]'' from the [[Acquisitions Incorporated]]. The game is ramping up in popularity across Laylan and has begun its movement through Mahra Coulta.

#### Introduction
PC's will enter the local tavern and see folks playing a game, involving these cards. One NPC will lose the game, get mad, and storm out, leaving his cards. The other invites a PC to take over, offering this Starter Deck for free. Players will be given ten simple cards (orcs, goblins, etc.), both in game and IRL. 

Players can go from town to town trying to find new cards for their game. Roll on a d10 table to see what cards they find when they go. A way for them to spend some gold, learn something about the world, and do some gambling.

#### Rules
The game begins with both participants drawing 2 cards from the top of their shuffled deck of 10. 

Each round a player will choose from one card in their hand to play face-down, both cards are then revealed and each player will roll an attack of 1d12+CR (Challenge Rating) against their opponents monster. The higher value wins and the losing monster is considered dead and removed from the game. The winner's monster is shuffled back into the deck. Cards are drawn from the deck until there are 2 in hand and a new round begins. 
If there is a tie, both monsters are shuffled back into the deck and a new round begins.

The game ends when a player only has one card left in their hand, being unable to choose between two in their hand and will lose. If both players have one or less cards at this point the game is voided.

A deck of cards can have a maximum total of 30CR.

##### Additional Rules
- On a 12, double your CR bonus or half your opponents CR bonus this round.
- On a 5, swap your monster in play with the opponents and add CR as usual
- On a 1, the hand of the player who rolled it is destroyed and all cards in play too.

#### Rewards
The winner of the duel may select any 1 card from the opposing persons active deck and add it to their collection.

If the winner chooses not to take any card they can have the loser pay a suitable amount dependent on where the game is being played but the average is 2-3 silver.

### Expansion
A recent expansion has been made by 'Lizards of the Coast' with a whole new set of monster cards and a new mechanic known as 'Spells'.

In this expansion players draw 3 cards, 2 from their monster deck and 1 from their spell deck. These spells have various effects but all increase the CR rating of the monster in play and can be played at any time.
