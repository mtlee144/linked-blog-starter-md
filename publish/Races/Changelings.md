#Worldbuilding 


Made by the [[Issylra, goddess of Shadows|raven queen]] as dolls that could have people/memories inserted, they instead were creatures that could change their shape and most happened to do so in a way to fit that memory. The [[Issylra, goddess of Shadows|Raven queen]] mistook that shape change to be them integrating the memories correctly and deemed their creation satisfactory. With the later realisation that she had been tricked she banished them from the [[Shadowfell]] to wander.

  

The changelings hold this memory close; some choose to pick a state that represents it, others attempt to hide it away by posing as someone else. Regardless they struggle to find their purpose as failed creations with implanted memories.
