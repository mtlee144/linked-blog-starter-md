#Worldbuilding 
A horned shadow looms within the morning mist behind Sanzo, he treads further up the mountain unawares of the increasing silhouettes shifting in his wake.

Despondent shells of shattered houses lay in waste as a lone figure stands within the wreckage, carrying the body of another. Shrinking down in size, the horned monstrosity slumps atop the body. The tears streaming down the Oni's face speak to the surrounding event as a substitute for the absence of words.

### Born of Giants

Created using the Giant’s of old as a template, Oni are born with naturally large bodies, an intimidating presence, and an ability to possess other beings; they are a persecuted and feared race. They are fierce fighters when their family is provoked, though if you were to watch the way they live you wouldn’t know.

### Stoic but Gentle

Despite the persecution, Oni are gentle and persevering. Humble mountain farmers, they are quiet creatures as they care for their loved ones. Despite this there have been Oni who have lost themselves to the rage though and perpetuated the stereotype of their fierceness.

### Appearance

Resembling tieflings they are humanoid in structure, their horns are smaller and more reminiscent of deer. They often sport red, blue or green tinged skin with silvery hair and pale white pupils. Their figure is lean but hides their strength and are slightly taller than the average human.

  

### Oni Names

Oni names are granted at their first revel if they are Blue or Red Oni. Sometimes, the names are from a famous Oni, or a powerful adversary, but often they are just words of meaning fused together in a drunken stupor.
