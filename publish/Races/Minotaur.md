Forged in Blackstone Volcano and infused with magic by [[Karthor, god of Fire and Forge|Karthor]], minotaurs are brutes and beasts, magma in their veins and an eruption of muscles they drive back hordes with large blows. With an innate sense for magic, though not often intelligent enough to use it well, they are blessed with a strong connection to the magical ley lines spreading from the Tree of Life.

  

Many minotaur spend their lives drawn to these crossroads of magic, whether to destroy them or use them they know not. Regardless of that decision they set forth from their homes to pursue their nature.
