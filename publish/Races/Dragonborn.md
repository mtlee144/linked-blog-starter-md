Descendants of [[Veltura, Dragon Lord|Veltura]], these humanoid beings seek power and honour. The pinnacle of this is known as the Dragonscent, a pilgrimage for those bearing [[Veltura, Dragon Lord|Veltura]]’s blood where they travel to Vel’Ruach and ascend its highest peak. The few who attempt this task believe they can ignite the deep dragon blood flowing within their veins and exceed their limits to which they grow usable wings. 

  

Those who choose to undertake this journey but fail sever their tail in shame, a mark of dishonour upon themselves and their kin.
