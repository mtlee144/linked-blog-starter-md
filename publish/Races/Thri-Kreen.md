#Worldbuilding 
Humanoid insects that thrive in Matriarchal colonies. Their females are moth-like and dainty, flitting from tree to tree taking care of the young whilst the male beetles hunt diligently for food. Living by a caste system the queenâ€™s eggs are coloured to determine their class and from birth these spawn are set to fulfil that duty in the hope of moving up in their next spawn.
