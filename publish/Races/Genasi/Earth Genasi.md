The Genasi themselves are spirits from their respective elemental plane that while on the material plane take a physical form that acts as a vessel that anchors them to the plane. Like a snail or hermit crab they find or make a new one as the spirit themselves mature and increase in power.

  

Eventually they can get to the point where their vessel is ultimately affected by the spirit e.g. the body fully turning into water not just the spirit leaving for a moment.

  

A main druidic tribe of each type live on their respective leyline to guard it, their leader is given a title e.g. FlameSpeaker, EarthBreather, AirWeaver, WaterWhisperer. Genasi will often undertake a pilgrimage to the other 3 tribes to create a balanced learning.

-   Blackstone Volcano isn't the fire leyline but a crossroads of leylines where the elements gather opposite the tree of life.
    **The Earth Genasi are versatile folk, able to adapt to almost any situation. Their anchor body often reflects this as they frequently alter or change it completely to fit the situation. As they grow older they tend to do this less and less until they settle on one body for the remainder of their time. This is most often seen by the deep rooted foliage that has begun growing from their bodies.**
