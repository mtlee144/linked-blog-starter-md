The Genasi themselves are spirits from their respective elemental plane that while on the material plane take a physical form that acts as a vessel that anchors them to the plane. Like a snail or hermit crab they find or make a new one as the spirit themselves mature and increase in power.

  

Eventually they can get to the point where their vessel is ultimately affected by the spirit e.g. the body fully turning into water not just the spirit leaving for a moment.

  

A main druidic tribe of each type live on their respective leyline to guard it, their leader is given a title e.g. FlameSpeaker, EarthBreather, AirWeaver, WaterWhisperer. Genasi will often undertake a pilgrimage to the other 3 tribes to create a balanced learning.

-   Blackstone Volcano isn't the fire leyline but a crossroads of leylines where the elements gather opposite the tree of life.
    

**The Air Genasi love fashion, their humanoid shell is often adorned prettily with jewels and tattoos with an 'airy' vibe. This body is often the reason they’re even on the Material Plane as they can’t manifest it properly on the plane of air. They’re often very vain or apathetic to others and make sure you know about it.**
