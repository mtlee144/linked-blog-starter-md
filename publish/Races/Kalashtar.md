The Kalashtar are born within [[Nocturne]], the domain of dreams, as manifestations of imagination. Often a Kalashtar will leave [[Nocturne]] in search of the one who dreamt them into being, some just to witness their creator, others to destroy them. 

  

Leaving [[Nocturne]] takes a toll on the Kalashtar though and must leave much of their original form, this ensuing incarnation is reminiscent of any other type of humanoid but there is an unmistakable ‘dream’ quality to them still.

-   They get a ‘form of dream’ which reverts them back into their original form for 1 minute. Similar to ‘form of dread’.
