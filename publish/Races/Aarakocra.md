Originally from the Elemental plane of Air, these creatures migrated to the Material Plane in search of power. Unbeknownst to them, generations later, those still in Adestria have had their affinity with the winds lost, their wings clipped, unable to stay aloft for long periods of time.Â 


Confined within the dark caves of [[Thesah]] on Mahra Coulta, they dive for fish in short bursts.

Yet many young Aarakocra continue to hope for the day when they will be able to soar once again through the air without limitation.
