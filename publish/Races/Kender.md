Gnomes cursed by [[Sethol, The Devourer|Sethol]] to devour. Each time an ‘Unblooded’ Kender is born, a separate but identical Kender is born known as the ‘Blooded’ and is distinguished by a red mark of some kind on its body. Due to [[Sethol, The Devourer|Sethol]]’s curse the Blooded, sometimes called ‘branded’ are magically driven to hunt and devour their twin within 25 years lest they themselves die. Trapped within an endless cycle of survival the Kender live a twisted life of fear.

-   Once a day a Kender can psychically attune to the other and see what the other is seeing for 1 minute. Both are aware this is happening.
