Imbued by A’Llonnah, these descendants of divine beings come in all forms depending on the essence of divinity that runs in their blood. Perhaps a divine being that served [[Karthor, god of Fire and Forge|Karthor]] had relations with a humanoid, somewhere along their ancestry an Aasimar will awaken as they reach adulthood. 

  

With angelic traits befitting their progenitor, they have often been revered as prophets, incarnations or the deities themselves by cultists and the ignorant. Alienated and alone, nevertheless an Aasimar seeks the truth of its origin, ultimately deciding whether to take it as a blessing and follow their ordained path or to fight it as a curse.
