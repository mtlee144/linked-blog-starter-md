#Worldbuilding 



The longest living race upon Adestria, they live along the Coral Coastline of Mahra Coulta in a half submerged city known as Azoum. The Tortle constantly morph their city to adapt to the changing times but have never finished in time, often one side of the city is being finished whilst the other side has already started being altered.

  

Their leader is known as the Caretaker who tends to the city and ‘the Clock’, a large ornate remnant from a forgotten period of time depicts a map of the stars. Each time an important event happens within Adestria it chimes, each fourth chime the current Caretaker will die feeding his life force into ‘the Clock’ seemingly winding it for its next Caretaker.
