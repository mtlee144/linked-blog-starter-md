## Hook

In the year 914 PD there exists a prophecy that speaks of an ill omen, of cataclysmic proportions that will bring ruin to the continent of Mahra Coulta. Whether you’ve been brought to the temple of [[Emon, god of Death|Kirat]] for that purpose or in pursuit of hidden treasures within, the locals bear witness to strange happenings and warn you to give up.


# The End

With a final screech, sands explode from his body to join the surrounding black sands that begin to shift upward, swallowed by the bell of [[Emon, god of Death|Emon]]. A second passes with no trace of necrotic sand left until the bell drops from the sky, crashing into the temple beneath turning it to sand.

  
You fall with it, the entire structure disintegrating underneath. Yet with a gentle kshhh you land safely on the bottom, cushioned by the soft sands.

  

Sitting on the top of this new sand dune, the exhaustion hits your body all at once as you watch the two suns of Adestria set across the city of [[Vashan]] in the distance.

  

…

  

And so it is chronicled in the annals of the [[History of Adestria]], 2/3 brave warriors [[Wilji Luckyflint]], [[Kingiri]] who stopped the incarnation of [[Emon, god of Death|Emon]] from corrupting the lands of Mahra Coulta … may [[Tahaanu, god of Heroes|Tahaanu]]’s blessing rest upon them.
