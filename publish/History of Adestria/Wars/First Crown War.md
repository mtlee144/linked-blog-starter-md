#War 

A long war of attrition between the [[Veridian Enclave]] and the [[Blackstone Legion]] for resources and land.

### Timeline
Beginning in 533PD the people of [[Old Blackstone]] warn the people of the [[Veridian Enclave]] to become part of the [[Blackstone Legion]] or risk conflict and inevitable destruction.

The [[Veridian Enclave]] respond with an attempt for peaceful negotiation but refuse to assimilate.

##### Conflict ensues
The conflict begins as Blackstone attempt to siege Enclave territory though the isthmus between the two sides of Laylan make it difficult to launch anything but a straight forward attack. Additionally the topological altitude proves too much for the members of the [[Blackstone Legion]] to attempt a flank - they would have to venture way down, cross the sea and challenge the treacherous jungle.


##### Resources dwindle
Several years later, though making headway, the [[Blackstone Legion]] chooses to relent with admiration to the 'softer' folk of the [[Veridian Enclave]]. The resources lost and projected time to complete this siege outweighed the potential resources gained.


##### Aftermath
The 4 long years of war took its toll on both peoples and the after effects cause much dissension within the people as to its worth.

Officially no treaty is signed between the factions.
