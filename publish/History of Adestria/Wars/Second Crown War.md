#War 

The second official war between the [[Blackstone Legion]] and the [[Veridian Enclave]]. 
It is unsure what the origins of the conflict were, some believe there was a sordid and secret relationship between members of the rulers between the two factions, others speculate there was an unknown party that instigated the conflict, majority believe it is was a matter of resources similar to the first war.

### Timeline
Sometime within the year 971PD the second crown war begins as both factions meet on the isthmus of the continent of Laylan. No attempts at friendly communications are issued.

#### A long war
Several years go by as the conflict escalates and lulls there are several points within the 12 years of war where new issues reignite the conflict:


##### Differing Ideologies
For the first few years of war, the history between the two factions especially the [[First Crown War]], was enough for both factions to continue fighting.

Yet with increased animosity, midway through the 3rd year of the war, the difference in ideologies reminiscent of the Cultivator Deities and the Betrayer gods similar to [[The Dusk]] was brought into play as religious ideologies conflicted. The future dawned upon each nation that the religious laws of the other faction would be enforced dividing the people more.

##### The Broken Treaty
With depleted resources after 7 years of war, official dignitaries from both factions are sent to attempt to sign a treaty. The communications fall through as a member of the liason's that the [[Veridian Enclave]] had sent is assassinated on the road. The conflict flares up in response and the war continues.

##### A New Ruler
At the 9th year of war the reigning ruler of the [[Blackstone Legion]], Torrid Blackstone, dies of old age to which his wife and queen becomes ruler in lieu of the current heir who is only 7 years of age. She is corrupt and driven by madness that the young heir to the throne might die, especially if they were to lose the war to the [[Veridian Enclave]]. 

She begins enslaving many non-combatants to join the war effort and the soldiers rally out of fear of their new ruler and of their precious loved ones who are now being conscripted.


##### The Empire Appears
Launching a three-fold attack, in the 11th year of the Second Crown War, the [[Paradian Empire]] appears from behind both forces as well as the very middle of the isthmus passage, the centre of the war.

For several reason this tactic was effective:
- The [[Paradian Empire]] at the time was supposedly a small faction that had only officially named itself an empire in the previous year.
- Due to the topology of the area, it was difficult for either faction to attempt a flank as sending a significant enough force across the seas was not stealthy enough as well as several failed attempts across the 11 years created a false sense of security within both factions.
- Finally the third prong was especially unexpected due to neither faction understanding how they could arrive unnoticed in the centre of the war space. Having to suddenly defend against a new threat coming from several angles was too taxing and caused much disarray within the forces of the [[Blackstone Legion]] and the [[Veridian Enclave]].

Leading the charge within the centre of the war was the Paradian Commander Gren [[House Alabaster|Alabaster]] who swiftly led the conflict to an end by forcing both factions into submission.

##### Aftermath
3 months after the [[Paradian Empire]] appear the war ends in the year 983PD, 12 years later, with both the [[Veridian Enclave]] and [[Blackstone Legion]] surrendering.

An invitation is issued to both factions to join as part of the[[Paradian Empire]], one united Empire but under its rule.

Taking stock of their remaining resources, both factions accept the invitation from the Empire to join. The ollowing year
