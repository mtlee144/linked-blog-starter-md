#War

Fought using living weapons against the [[Warforged]] and mecha armoured humanoids.

### Timeline
When the conflict began is unrecorded but historians best understanding would be toward the beginning of 9452AC.

##### The First Attack
The original members of [[The Living Flock]] sought to tear apart Mahra Coulta beginning with the native colonies to steal their craft for their weapons. These colonies are now referred to as the Ix'ali from the [[Kingdom of Ix'al]] and are known for esoteric forms of magic.

The first siege is upon a colony of weapon makers from within. The remaining colonies do nothing to aide, instead choosing to bolster their defences.

##### The Second Attack
With enhanced weapons they strike at a second and third colony through the  front gates, demonstrating their power. Several nearby colonies evacuate rather than remaining in their stronghold.

##### The Colonies Act
A rescue call is sent out and a census is taken resulting in a majority of colonies choosing to join forces under the clause that their technologies remain secret from each other. 

Their combined efforts result in weaponized robots known as [[Warforged]] that can fight for them.

##### The Conflict
This response from the colonies is strong but there's a fatal flaw, without a form of communication between the control towers and the [[Warforged]], drawn out are not in their favour as any shift in strategy from what as programmed before the battle results in the [[Warforged]] being unable to act properly.

The colonies react by taking a second census, it's outcome determining that technological and/or magical secrets for the duration of the war lest they all be destroyed.

Several months later magical mechanical suits known as '[[Spartans]]' are created that allow the user to fight with the strength of a [[Warforged]] as well as command the robotic infantry around them thus turning the tide.

##### Duel at [[The Shattered Peaks]]
Climaxing on the eve of the year 9450AC, a summit is called between the leaders of [[The Living Flock]] and the colonies of Mahra Coulta as the amount of cult members had dwindled significantly and [[Warforged]] were inoperable.

The summit leads to a fight settled by a champion from each party.

The fight itself is believed to have lasted for 20 hours with the death of the champion from [[The Living Flock]], the colonies of Mahra Coulta are victorious.

##### Aftermath
Out of the documented 900 or so colonies on Mahra Coulta, approximately 650 came to the aid of the others and joined forces. 380 colonies were destroyed in the 2 year conflict with unknown casualties. 

A third census is taken. The colonies choose to close their doors again to each other.

Of the 1000 members of [[The Living Flock]], several were believed to have been wielding vestiges of [[Karthor, god of Fire and Forge|Karthor]] known as [[Karthor, god of Fire and Forge#Karthorâ€™s Arms|Karthor's Arms]] . At the Duel upon [[The Shattered Peaks]] an unknown amount of members remained though an estimation of 200 was made.
