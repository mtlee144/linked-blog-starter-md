The Spellplague, called the Blue Breath of Change by those who understand its property, was a disastrous disease that struck much of Adestria in 2605AC and released by [[Cyric, the Mad one|Cyric]]. It continued for 4 years during which arcane magic ceased to function.

The origin came from a magical disease that [[Cyric, the Mad one|Cyric]] infected the Arch-Conduit and [[Kalashtar]] of [[O'llon, god of Music and Magic|O'llon]] - O'Fallon, to which mutated the virus such that any infected would have their link with the god of music and magic anulled.

### The First Outbreak
The Spellplague manifested in the lost city of Toril on Mahra Coulta as a storm of blue flames erupted in the centre of the city.
Creatures and individuals who came in contact with the initial explosion were killed. Those who were touched by the remaining flames were infected, the effects progressing through these symptoms:
- Heavy Fever
- Coughing infectious blue flames
- Any liquid released from the body carries the infection
- Random 1st-3rd degree burns

The effects would last 3 weeks at which point four things could happen:
1. The patient recovers with no lasting effects
2. The patient recovers but cannot use magic
3. The patent succumbs to the plague and dies
4. The patient becomes Spellscarred

##### Spellscarred
Very rarely those who have survived the effects of the Spellplague develop a mutation that actually strengthens their connection to [[O'llon, god of Music and Magic|O'llon]] - the current theory being the the mutation causing a burst or increased magical capacity as their magic returns causing this phenomenon.

The effects are different with each case but some documented effects have allowed individuals to sense the presence of the Spellplague nearby, an increased lifespan, and enhanced abilities that were present before they contracted the virus.

The only common variable across all cases is the seering pain the infected experiences when activating magic as well as a blue flame that appears on their forehead.

One individual in [[House Relh]] can actually use this fire to heal.


### A Second Outbreak
Thought to have been contained on the continent of Mahra Coulta, an outbreak is recorded on West Laylan causing mass destruction in its wake. Believed to have been brought across the seas to [[Port Damby]] by refugees who had no other choice the Spellplague begins spreading across Laylan.


#### Cure
A remedy to the Spellplague is discovered in its 3rd year by a druid centaur named Saffron. It involves a scarce mushroom from the [[Underdark]] known as [Aldaka](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/herbes.php?vo=aldaka), a root from a mountain [mandrake](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/herbes.php?vo=mandrake), bark from the [Lessentor](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/herbes.php?vo=lessentor) tree, and liquid from an infected patient to which will then be given back to the patient in the form of an ingested liquid.

Unfortunately due to the scarcity of the Aldaka mushroom this cure is unable to be widely spread and only those along East Laylan are able to procure it.

### Aftermath
The pandemic lasts for 4 years to which a vast majority of arcane magic disabled. With a cure found but not largely available majority of infected choose to deal with the effects for the 3 weeks despite the mortality rate killing 1 in 3. 

The virus continues to spread but the chance to be infected again is medium to low and antibodies and less so for those born after. 

The Spellplague virus is now considered a household infection in the era of Post Divergence but one that can't be taken lightly if infected.
