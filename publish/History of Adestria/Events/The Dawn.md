[[The Creator]] bestowed upon this plane the seed of life. And from it, as it grew, [[The Creator]] manifested form from its energy and life began. The seas roared into existence as a singular land mass took form, separating itself from the sky. Beasts of all shapes and intellect sprung forth adapting to their individual environments.

[[The Creator]] saw upon what had been created before Him and separated His own life force to create entities we know as The gods. Each with their own capabilities and domains they resided over Adestria and for a time these beings were content to nurture, dwell and coexist with each other and the beings within Adestria. [[The Creator]] saw this and departed to rest.
