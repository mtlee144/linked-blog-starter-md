Beginning in 977AC, an arcane battle ensued between the Heads of each school of magic as each was adamant that their school was the epitome of magic. 

An arcane battle ensued within what has now become [[Old Blackstone]] that levelled two wards of the city, killing hundreds of civilians, and is now referred to as the Eve of Crimson Midnight. 

Realising what they had done the mages called a parley, deciding to put aside their differences to avoid mutually assured destruction and instead joining together under a magical accordance.
