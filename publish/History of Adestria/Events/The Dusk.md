These gods however had varying ideals for the plane of Adestria and split into factions befitting their ideals. One faction (The Cultivator Deities) believing that all life should be nurtured; another (The Betrayer gods) believing that nurturing all life will lead them to complacency and dependency and thus should learn to fend for themselves, and a final set of gods whom joined neither faction due to various reasons.

  

Thus the Cultivator Deities fought the Betrayer gods bringing destruction across Adestria. The one landmass split into hundreds of tiny fragments, the skies blackened as natural and unnatural forces rained upon the plane. Primordial beings and abyssal demons rose up to wreak havoc upon the whims of these warring gods, altering the landscape with their power.

  

This conflict lasted thousands of years, in an effective stalemate as their divine bodies were incapable of wounds, until a mischievous Betrayer God decided to strike the adolescent sprout born from the seed of life in the hopes that it would tip the scales in his favour. He was correct and the bolt struck true but it also reverberated through every being on the plane and awakened [[The Creator]] from His slumber. In righteous fury He tore that Betrayer God to pieces, abolishing him from existence
