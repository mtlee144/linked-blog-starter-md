## Rule of Cool
If it is cool and feasible, we doing. 
For super spicy things that might require a roll we will give advantage

### Finishing Blow
The end of initiative will be signified by the DM asking "how would you like to do this?"

This is a chance for you to do something special as a finishing blow. This can be fantastical but not out of the realm of possibility.

## Saving Throws
On a successful saving throw with damage or healing (if applicable), the roll is halved and rounded down.

## Death Saves
PCs roll their save behind the DM screen and shouldn't give away any reaction. DM will also ask for a memory of the PC before they roll.

If there are three successes the player will stabilise in that turn but will be unable to rejoin combat till their next one.
- clarify rejoining with 1 health


### Arcana Check
Magic is everywhere and fairly easy to sense its presence but you can use an arcana check to attempt to recall any information about magic that could potentially be in the area
- This is to allow for spells like 'Detect Magic' to still be used 

e.g. You remember that the symbols on the floor are a somatic component of _this_ spell.

## Stabilising in Combat
If a PC is stabilised (without healing) and returns to combat the PC returns with another level of [exhaustion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/appendix-a-conditions#Exhaustion) that lasts for an hour.

### Player Help
Another player can use a melee help action once per down, rolling a Medicine Check DC10:
- If successful the downed PC gains one success
- If unsuccessful, it will count as a fail to their death saving throws

Criticals work as per normal death saving rules.

## Inspiration
This is still a thing but changing it to be more on the fly. So if we think the decision or description was cool enough - based on rule of cool - we will give advantage to it or depending on situation might just have it work.

Advantage and its counterpart do not stack but can counteract each other.

## Criticals
You gain a critical hit if:
-   You roll a natural 20, or
-   Your attack roll is 10 or more above your target's AC
-   Spells can critical hit if they hit the requirements as well

### Attacks
Roll the usual + modifiers and then double the result.

### Skill checks
You can auto success on a natural 20 but cannot do something that is impossible. E.g. suddenly fly 

You can automatically fail on a natural 1 which will cause something bad to happen :D, up to my discretion.

## Action Economy
Bonus actions act similar to smaller spell slots compared to actions. You can do 2 bonus actions on a turn (taking up the action) but cannot do two actions.

### Action
Depending on size, throwing can be an action or bonus action.

### Bonus
#### Potions
Except for trying to give it to someone else

#### Shoving
Requires a contested roll

#### Two weapon fighting
Your off hand can use a secondary weapon to make an attack, this weapon must have the light.
- The primary weapon hand does not need these restrictions as long as it can be wielded with one hand

It will not receive an ability modifier to its chance to hit but applies damage as normal.
- This is so the fighting style is still viable.

Since this is a bonus action it is separate to attacks made with the 'Extra Attack' feature.


### Free

#### Talking/Checks
Whatever is reasonable within the 6 seconds, we will upscale this as it seems appropriate.

#### Swapping Weapons
No cost 

## Spellcasting 
Magic Missiles - roll each dice (it's more fun than rolling one die)

### Concentration
If you're concentrating you need to wear the santa hat - dubbed the concentration dunce cap because we suck at remembering that's something we need to do :D

### Focus
As long as you have your spellcasting focus on you I don't mind if you want to flavour it as if it happens in another way e.g. casting from your hand

### Components
We will assume you start the campaign with all components you need.

This is extended to any spells obtained by learning (wizard) or levelling up.

The only time you'd need to buy or find a material component(s) is if it will expend that material. This is noted by a money value next to the spell component.

## Exhaustion spell slots
You can attempt to cast a spell using a spellslot you have run out of at the cost of one exhaustion level. Casting the spell will require a successful DC10 + spellslot level.

This is intended to be more of a last resort thing but can be applied earlier.

## Levelling Up
We will be running off milestone so that roleplay and story will be dictating how and when you level up

### Health on level
We will reroll any 1's as you gain permanent health during level up.

### Multiclassing
No base stat requirement for this, if you want to take a level in something you are most welcome.


## No Encumbrance
Tracking encumbrance is annoying. If it seems like you can't carry everything than you can't.

It is ultimately up to you how you want to organise your currency on your sheets and how you want to add to or remove increments. i.e. exchanging from a [[Currency#Paradia|Platinum Paradia]] into a smaller increment is fine and it'll be up to you on how to manage that on your character sheet.


## Calendar's
Don't worry about tracking days, it's painful and I'll honestly forget. Just let the days/events happen.

If it is super imperative for some reason then we will track it but for the most part I will endeavour to have us not worry about it.
