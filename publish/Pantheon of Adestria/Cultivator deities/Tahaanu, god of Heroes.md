Due to the nature of those who are blessed by Tahaanu and the ensuing festivals that occur in their honour, he is also known as the god of Revel and many towns and cities will celebrate The Revelry in the hope that Tahaanu may bless someone from their home.

## Holy Day

The Revelry - a festival celebrated at the beginning of the second month in the year by many throughout Adestria of great heroes from history blessed by Tahaanu. Many pray and give offerings on this day that they may too be blessed and become a hero. Makeshift depictions of these heroes are crafted and walked through the towns toward the highest spot whilst plays reenacting their escapades are shown.
