The realm of Tokki extends to wherever the seas shift and the land grows wild. As the keeper of the forests both present or absent, Tokki represents the wild creatures of nature, the rush of the angry rapids, and the heat-heavy stillness of the desert.

Druids dislike his joyful antics that coax the seeds he’s planted to grow as he skips from grove to grove, eschewing a permanent realm; Tokki prefers to wander the plane to oversee natural life, the druids are reluctant to share in this part but never neglect to pay their respects.

  

## Appearance

Tokki resembles a Halfling or a young firbolg, with tousled brown hair, he springs around the forest helping plants grow and playing tricks on people who get lost in his woods. Any place his cape made from leaves touches grows

  

## Holy Day

Those who worship Tokki revere him all year round.

  
## Vestige
### Tokki’s Bowl

The records detail a large cracked vessel made from a mysterious metal, able to mould surrounding earth and plant life as if it was clay. 


## Commandments

-   Protect the untamed wilderness from exploitation and destruction.
    
-   Growth is a time for fun, have some fun.
    
-   Embrace and respect the savage nature of the world. Exist in harmony with it, or don’t.
