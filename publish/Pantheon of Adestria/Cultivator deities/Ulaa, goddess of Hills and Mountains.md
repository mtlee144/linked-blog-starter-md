alias: Ulaa, Landbearer

#god #npc 
From rolling hills to jagged peaks, Ulaa, the Landbearer, holds it all close to her bosom hiding bounties and dangers deep within. She shaped the mountain ranges and [[Underdark]] tunnels with her warhammer SkullRinger. More uncommonly she is the patron protector of the hearth and home and is often depicted within wooden reliefs above fireplaces in people’s homes, though many have not made the connection.

From the dirt and using her likeness, [[The Creator]] brought forth the dwarven race and she loves them like a mother does for her child. Despite the [[Dwarves]]' natural reverence for her, many do not actively worship her though for any land dweller it’s difficult to ignore her presence within the ground they hold to. Those who do choose to worship Ulaa often show respect to her husband [[Tokki, god of the Forests|Tokki]] as the caretaker of all plant life, hence majority of temples to Ulaa are partnered with [[Tokki, god of the Forests|Tokki]].

  

## Appearance

Ulaa resembles a motherly Dwarven lady with long, braided red hair, heavy set figure and often reasonably dirty. Her hammer, Skullringer, looks just like a huge slab of metal slapped onto a stick with some gearing along the side. 

  

## Holy Day

(Landfell) Autumn Equinox - A day where people celebrate their family, spending all day together doing activities and eating food together. Only those who worship Ulaa know that the tradition is based on her.

## Vestige
### The Jade Heart

A large jewel emits a distinct glow. When other objects are put in its vicinity for a varying amount of time, that object will then also glow. 


## Commandments

-   Home is where the land is.
    
-   There is nothing better than familiar ground.
    
-   The land is firm, unmoving, foundational. Be like Land.
