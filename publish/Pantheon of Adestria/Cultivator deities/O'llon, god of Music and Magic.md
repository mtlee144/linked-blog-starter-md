alias: O'llon

Magic is music; the incantations spoken are lyrics, the somatic gestures are dances. This is what O'llon presides over. Whether they understand that or not, many who pursue one intertwine themselves with the other to the chagrin of many wizards. With jolly rotundness O’llon heralds the ever changing nature of music and magic, with his lute he weaves magic throughout the land of Adestria.

Only the bards acknowledge his command over all things arcane yet and fewer still choose to worship him, yet O’llon cares not as he strums away thankful for the opportunity he has been given.

  

Despite his domain, O'llon composed the race of Giants, one seemingly based upon great physicality rather than magic. Perhaps as contrast to his domain, or perhaps there's a hidden song deep within the Goliath people.

  

## Appearance

O’llon resembles a goliath with a great dad bod yet still spry on his feet. With brown skin, tousled hair, a septum piercing, and a shaggy beard O’llon fills the air with music for any mood. His instrument takes any form but most commonly in a tanned lute with gold embossing and no strings from which he commands magic.

  

## Holy Day

The history books describe a holy day for the god of music but has since been forgotten and though there are debates on recreating the festivities, the bards cannot agree on a suitable celebration due to creative differences.

## Vestige
### Scrolls of Creation

These pages are believed to have inscribed sections from the Song of Creation, the melody that created the cosmos and continue to resound through existence today.
