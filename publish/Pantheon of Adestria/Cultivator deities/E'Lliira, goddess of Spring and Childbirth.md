As the world sighs sending the winds that bring new fruits, as the bard’s inspiration blooms, as a baby's cry is heard amidst the joy of new parents, E’Lliira holds all within her grasp. Sister and counterpart to A’Llonnah, E’Lliira blesses the birth of new things regardless of what they are but only presides upon their beginnings, not anything past.
