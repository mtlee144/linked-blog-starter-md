alias: Iora, She Who Guides

#god#npc 

The twilit transition from light into darkness brings comfort and calm, as the day’s labours end and the hours of rest begin. Iora, goddess of the moon Yerah, holds dominion over the night as she guides the lost with her soft light. Her hand rests upon the world at night bringing comfort to children, illuminating the stars to guide sailors and keeping the suns, Lavan and Shakhor, in check. Many sailors, diviners and peacekeepers worship Iora, giving her the moniker She Who Guides. Those who mock her name are believed to never complete their journey.

After the Divine Law was established Iora created the Tiefling race to reflect her image though they weren't fully to her liking and proceeded to allow any of the gods the ability to govern and create their own tiefling subrace.

Instead, as part favour to the Lost God and her own desire she imbued a certain species of deer with her power creating the Waxing/[[Moon Deer]], creatures that would alter their form in a cycle that would reflect her own. 

  

She was believed to be the originator of lycanthropy as those plagued by its touch would lose control on a full moon. Further studies showed that the human nature that kept the werewolf in check became too subdued and calm during a full moon, releasing the beast within that cared not for Iora’s warm embrace. They therefore revoked the original idea but kept the euphemism “Iora’s Kiss”, one touched by lycanthropy was said to be “kissed by Iora”

  

## Appearance

She Who Guides is an ethereal, horned Tiefling lady who blesses those who gaze upon the moon with adoration. Her appearance changes from child to adult as the moon changes (Full = Adult, New Moon = Child). Her crescent staff reflects this change as well.
