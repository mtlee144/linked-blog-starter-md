#Worldbuilding 
In the absence of gods due to the Divine Gate, primordial beings from [[The Dusk]] freed from the whims of their divine masters corrupt mortals on Adestria with their machinations. These powerful entities amass a following that gives them power in proportion to their worship.

  

### Admenis, the Watcher

A Sphinx believed to have been alive since [[The Dawn]] and has seen all of history. That being said, there have been no sightings of Admenis for centuries, many believe the lack of following over the years has resulted in Admenis disappearing from the world yet still there remain a faithful remnant.

### Cat Lord

Those who truly understand felines know that the Cat Lord is neither good nor evil but concerned with cat-things alone.

  

### Lolth, the Spider Queen

The evil god of deceit, shadows, and spiders, Lolth weaves a complicated web of schemes and treachery through her worshipers, deceiving allies and enemies alike to gain power. It is said that the Spider Queen can see through the eyes of all spiders, and that she is truly all-knowing.

  

### Mammon, the Greedy

Arch-Demon of Greed who is believed to have established the Lost City, yielding his riches to any one who is greedy enough to seek it out. The children’s tale about Mammon warns that greedy children will find themselves trapped inside a snake’s body that Mammon will eat.

  

### Naviask, the Fey-Touched

Once a powerful balor pursuing total annihilation of the [[Feywild]], its magic twisted him, changing his mission to destroy into a quest to heal scarred lands with nature. After the [[Divergence]], Naviask was drawn back to Adestria, where he currently remains, seeking to heal the devastation and ruin that still plague the world.

### Vesh, the Bloody Siren

None know whether Vesh is a witch or a demigod, but she has walked Adestria for centuries, seducing those who pry into forbidden magics and drawing them to her as possible suitors. Acolytes cultivate sects of worshipers who engage in ritualistic orgies and masochistic rites, these hedonistic rituals culminating with her selection of a mate. Vesh feeds on the unchosen in a bloody massacre before laying with her selected survivor and vanishing to her realm. Their essences intertwined, she then lends her strength to her mate, watching over them for life.

  

### Xalicas, the Judge

An angel with silvered-skin with one blackened wing and bandaged eyes. She is known as the Judge or the arm of [[Belial, The Judge|Belial]] that would bring swift judgement on those who fell upon [[Belial, The Judge|Belial]]’s scales. Now stripped of her master due to the Divine Gate she cries out in despair uncertain of where she should swing her blade.
