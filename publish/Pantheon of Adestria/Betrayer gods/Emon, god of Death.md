As E’Lliira brings life, Emon oversees death and the passage of the soul. With a soft jingle he appears to those whose time is near and whisks them away gently. The wicked are promised a different end though as screams and anguish and gnashing of teeth precede their death.

Though his domain causes grief, many do not despise him for it and devout followers worship his fairness with great reverence. 

 

His fiends are his labourers but their nature makes them fickle and prone to greed and power, often making deals with humanoids in exchange for their souls.

  

## Appearance

A tall, slender hunched-over being swathed in a shadowy cloak. Emon wears a mask covered in bells. 

  

Only the wicked know his true form. From ravings of those about to die, a record has been made that depicts Emon as head to toe cloaked in flowing, black bandages with demonic eyes peering from the gaps.

  

## Holy Day

None


## Vestige
### Chimes

These small black silver bells are remnants of [[Emon, god of Death|Emon]]’s power and have been scattered across Adestria, so far only two have been found. Each one, when rung brings forth an aspect of death in some way.

## Commandments

-   Death is the natural end of all life. There is no pity for those who have fallen.
    
-   Undeath is an atrocity. Those who pervert the transition of the soul must be brought down.
    
-   An inevitability, yet fear it not.
