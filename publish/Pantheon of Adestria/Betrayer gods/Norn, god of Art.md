#god #npc 
The god of Art, literature, poetry and emotion, Norn is a whimsical fellow who does what he wants with a pert grin on his face as he does it.

He created the [[Feywild]] purely as a joke, a mockery of the [[Issylra, goddess of Shadows|Raven Queen]]’s realm, the [[Shadowfell]]. As a reflection of the Material Plane suffused with potent magic and unbridled emotion, the [[Feywild]] exists in the corner of the eye, an echo as one turns their head quickly, resting just beyond reach yet tantalisingly close.

  

Artists and poets alike, those who seek the essence of art find themselves wildly following the trail that Norn has drawn within the world.
