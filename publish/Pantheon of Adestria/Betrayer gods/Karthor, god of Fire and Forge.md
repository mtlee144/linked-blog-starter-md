#god #npc 
Blazing infernos, clanging steel, bubbling lava all find their origin in Karthor. By his hand he forged mountain ranges into erupting volcanos that reshaped the lands beneath, his breath brought fire to the nations and by his axe the Cultivator Deities were almost sent running.

Worshipped by smiths, artisans, and miners alike, Karthor has earned his devotion by the works of his hands and the bellow of his fires. Those who seek to join are not given instruction but are expected to learn by watching and doing.

  

## Appearance

A molten [[Minotaur]] who cares not for the destruction he leaves in his wake. 

  

## Holy Day

The Burn - A day where a burning competition is held for devout followers of Karthor who spend the whole 24 hours in the sweltering heat of the forge, creating all sorts of metalworks before casting everything that did not win the competition back into the blazing forge. It is fairly common for many competitors to faint during.

It is the only time fire is used to forge in [[Raggen'Thrum]].


## Vestige
### Karthor’s Arms

Believed to have been crafted during [[The Age of Conduits]], [[Karthor, god of Fire and Forge|Karthor]]’s arms are sentient weapons forged from the souls of fiends by [[Karthor, god of Fire and Forge|Karthor]] for his champions. These artefacts are more than just magic items but rather powerful sentient beings, filled with fury and eager to be wielded - and to spill blood.

#### Pitch black 

A pitch black sword with horns that can control a target hit if they fail the save


#### Crimson Scream

A green whip that makes the target bleed for many turns after



#### Hellfire

A shield made of bone, with a flaming orb in the centre that creates undead

## Commandments

-   Neither fire nor forge is for the weak willed. 
    
-   Patiently, with measured force, strike fiercely, strike hard.
    
-   If you need something, make it yourself.


## Nomenclature
Forgeheads - Many professional forge workers are known for only being able to think about one thing, completely unaware whilst forging that there is anything else going on around them.
