alias: Sethol, The Devourer

#god #npc 
A swirling mass of necrotic chaos, Sethol is a sentient void of infinite depth that only craves destruction and madness. Effectively an unknown variable, The Devourer was forced into a more physical manifestation during [[The Dusk]] and is believed, by the Bhuru people, to be chained under the sea by the [[Lord of the Deep]].

Due to Sethol’s nature, it was given the Sahuagin species to govern rather than creating a race. The Devourer cares little for his followers or much of anything really, instead forcing them to be self-sufficient, to seek destruction and madness such as it.

  

## Appearance

Sethol is believed to have been forced into a form that somewhat resembles a large shark, with a mouth of swirling darkness and an endless row of teeth and crazed eyes.
