#god #npc 
The goddess of Dreams and Destiny eternally rests within the realm of the sleeping, the [[Nocturne]], where fantastical imaginations become real. Each being is resplendent and gorgeous, often taking on the form of a pleasant or silly jester-like appearance. Within this theatre of dreams the [[Kalashtar]] reside as manifestations of these dreams.
