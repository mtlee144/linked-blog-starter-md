#god #npc 
Pensive faces, minds lost in memories of nights long past, Issylra lurks within their umbra, waiting to grab hold of them. She developed the [[Shadowfell]] as an extension of her domain, an echo of the Material Plane where she could reside and be left to her machinations. Many believe when they experience a bad dream or remember a traumatic experience, that their soul briefly dipped into the [[Shadowfell]].

The Raven Queen is trapped by her fascination with the past. She sits in the shadows, amidst all the memories of the world, looking at the ones that please her most as though they were glittering jewels. Many great wizards have attempted to understand her motives, but like a raven she has always remained cryptic, keeping her cache of secrets just out of their reach.

  

Those who are blessed by Issylra often lose a memory important to them in exchange for great power.
