Twin trickers who cared not for the dispute between the Cultivator deities and the Betrayer Gods, if anything making things more difficult through their continued antics. With joyful giggles they sowed dubious seeds causing chaos across the realm till they vanished from historical records some time during [[The Age of Conduits]] but perhaps it's just another one of their tricks.
