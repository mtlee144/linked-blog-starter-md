#god #npc 
The two suns, Shakhor and Lavan, trace the sky of Adestria ever in harmony by the power of Belial the Judge. His scales judge fairly just as his suns shed light and magic upon the Material Plane. When Belial is not guiding the suns through the sky, it is believed [[Iora, goddess of the Moon|Iora]] governs the sky instead.

The [[Holy Guild of Belial]] began as a church in [[The Age of Conduits]] honouring and worshipping the two suns and now serve as judges when concerning legal matters and merchant issues.

  

## Appearance

Belial has various depictions but many artist interpretations have settled on a humanoid figure in a large white Abaya, white mask, a gold body and a large golden ring floating behind him, half spouting black fire and the other red.

  

## Holy Day

The Balance - a holiday celebrated from the last day of the year through to the first day of the year, known as Shakhor’s day and Lavan’s day respectively. Many celebrate in honour of the two suns that bring light and magic upon Adestria and welcome the new year in by offering a gift of a wreath made of red and black flowers to a family on Shakhor’s day. To which that family will invite them over for a meal the following day in exchange for the gift.

  

## Commandments

Belial has no official commandments based on tradition or liturgy but the Holy Guild has established their own.

-   Order must be maintained. 
    
-   For everything, there is an exchange
