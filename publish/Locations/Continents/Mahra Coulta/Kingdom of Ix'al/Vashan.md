In a farming colony, known as Vashan, within [[Kingdom of Ix'al|Ix'al]] in 914PD, the team are individually going around town asking for information on the temple and its re-emergence over the last two months.

-   The town farms Vashani silk, a trademark of the Ix’al. Named so because of the small Vashani Shrub whose leaves are eaten by the peculiar [[Emon, god of Death|Kirat]] silkworm, the bark is also used for medicinal purposes whilst the wood is used for magical ornaments.
    

-   The silkworm, after digesting the leaves from the Vashani Shrub, will create a beautiful silk able to handle and utilise magic.
    

Vashan is a town shaped in concentric circles of housing and thin but dense lines of Vashani shrubbery. The outer circle is surrounded by high sandstone walls with large doors that open upward where commercial goods made from the specialised silk are sold, similar to an Egyptian Bazaar. The remaining circles are housing or farming. 

  

As the [[Emon, god of Death|Kirat]] silkworm is a meek worm that dislikes sunlight, the shrubbery is dense and sealed by long wooden awnings. The decrease of sunlight makes it difficult for the Vashani Shrub to grow (a unique from the area that grows in a way that creates difficulty for growing itself) but farmers have developed a system that revolves around using the ‘Fog cloud’ spell within the enclosure for water and an almost continuous use of the ‘Daylight’ spell to act as an additional sun during the day, effectively creating 3 suns. The constant artificial water and sunlight provides an apt environment for the Vashani Shrub to thrive as well as the [[Emon, god of Death|Kirat]] silkworm to live comfortably.

  

-   The people are all dressed in large billowing bodysuits, like thick burkas or Hazmat suits that catch the wind
    

  

-   There's no weapon shop, they rely on the high sandstone walls. They can chat to the owners of the wall shops
    
-   They can visit the area where the crops have withered, asking the distressed farmers
    
-   The bazaar is the largest tavern in the area 
    

  

### Vashani Bazaar

Music - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2XGnVF968I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2XGnVF968I) 

An open tavern with a very thick fabric covering the top to stop the 3 suns. There are several stray cats lazing around the area.

  

A [[Minotaur]] named Jeffrel, whose entire body has had a very close buzzcut, serves at the bar (they can see the sweat dripping constantly down his hairless body, almost accentuating the muscles). Meat is sparse and expensive to procure in the Mahran Desert so food is mostly vegetable.

-   Vashani Tea (2cp): Using leftover leaves and medicinal bark from the Vashani Shrub, a cold and bitter tea is made 
    
-   Koshary (4cp): A cold noodle and rice dish, with black lentils and chickpeas, served with two slices of rustic bread. There’s an additional spicy red sauce made from the excrement of the [[Emon, god of Death|Kirat]] Silkworm and an acidic vinegar sauce that can be added to taste.
    

Shop:

The wall behind the bar is filled with huge jars of different coloured glowing sands, a trademark of a nearby Ix’al colony (Delmirev) known as Delmiravi or star sand. These sands act similar to one-use magic scrolls.
