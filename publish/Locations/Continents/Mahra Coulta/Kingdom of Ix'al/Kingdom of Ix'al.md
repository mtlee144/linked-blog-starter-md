# Kingdom of Ix'al
#location 
*Based on Riot’s Ixtal

The oldest known Kingdom in Adestria dating back to the earlier centuries of [[The Age of Conduits]]. Ix’al spans across the Mahra Coulta based mainly in the Mahran Desert, having witnessed The [[Divergence]] from afar, they seclude themselves spending their time and energy harnessing the power of the elements that run rampant across Mahra Coulta.



The Ix’ali don’t inhabit one settlement but rather live in colonies of like minds where knowledge rules, a social hierarchy based on the length of time spent in study, furthering their progression toward ultimate mastery. The mages within this large arcology are adept at all forms of esoteric magic. For example, the Yun’al combine their understandings of fire, rock, and magnetism to draw precious metals from the earth, crafting them into exquisite shapes with the merest gesture. Whilst the Ix’tellar weave the elements and their magic to create shimmering garments that respond to the needs of the wearer.
