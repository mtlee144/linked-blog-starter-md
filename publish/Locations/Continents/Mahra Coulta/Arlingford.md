#location 

A coastal city situated next to the Redglade forest on a long hill down to the coast. There is a stone terraced thoroughfare that runs through the centre of the city and down to the the docks splitting the city in two.


Known for its trading route and Redglade wood export, it also happens to be the main dock that many venture to when arriving or leaving Mahra Coulta.
