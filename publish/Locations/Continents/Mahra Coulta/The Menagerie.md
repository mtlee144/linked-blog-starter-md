#location 

Originally a dwarven city that over the many thousands of years has been overtaken by orcs, then elves, then orcs again, then humans, then [[Dwarves]] who then gave it back to elves to goblins, and then humans. A rich mix of architecture and cultures now reside.

The sighing stone, a large monolith with a hole corroded through the middle that sighs when wind blows through.
