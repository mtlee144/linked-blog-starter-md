A secretive colony within the [[Kingdom of Ix'al]], hidden within the mountains of the Mandara Range, that is rumoured to only appear within a certain weather condition - mist.

The people are swift, persistent, and courageous - slipping into places and disappearing without a trace. The only way one can identify an individual from Mystfall is if that person chooses to reveal themselves and their peculiar markings of geometric ink that glows upon their body.

	"I cannot teach you courage. I cannot teach you tenacity. I cannot teach you who you are. The Mist is what it is, to grasp it is to grasp at that which has no form."
