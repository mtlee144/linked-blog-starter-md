Within a large cavern along the Western coastline, lies an Aarakocran city, where the settlement hangs from the ceiling like rafters. The floor floods nightly as the tides rise and fall thus the perfect habitat for an airborne race.Â 

-   Main commodity is fish that have been swept in with the rising tides. Often the Aaracokras have been witnessed swooping down from their homes to grab food though more often than not, large fishing rods are cast down like banyan trees when not actively diving.
