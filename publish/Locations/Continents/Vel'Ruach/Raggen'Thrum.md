Dwarven Stronghold where a large majority of the race live. They are a mighty folk and even just by living in Vel’Ruach is a boast to that testament. They utilise natural fire and a special technique involving a lack of fire to craft marvels.

The Frostforge is what Raggen’Thrum is known for. Named because of the technique they employ where no fire is used to weld things steel together.
- It stands behind a large wall of ice that marks their Great Hall so that no residual heat can enter. 
- Only masters of the forge are allowed to use the Frostforge, as the process itself is dangerous and one wrong move might weld the metals together at the wrong spot.

Many [[Dwarves]] leave Raggen’Thrum for the sole purpose of continuing their craft, they are stubborn but they understand that the outside world has much to offer, that of others marvelling at their work.
