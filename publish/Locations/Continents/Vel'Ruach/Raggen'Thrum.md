Dwarven Stronghold where a large majority of the race live. They are a mighty folk and even just by living in Vel’Ruach is a boast to that testament. They utilise natural fire and a special technique involving a lack of fire to craft marvels.

The Frostforge is what Raggen’Thrum is known for. Named because of the technique they employ where no fire is used to weld things steel together.

Many [[Dwarves]] leave Raggen’Thrum for the sole purpose of continuing their craft, they are stubborn but they understand that the outside world has much to offer, that of others marvelling at their work.
