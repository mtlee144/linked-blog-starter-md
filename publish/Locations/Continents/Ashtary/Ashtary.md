#location 

Largely unexplored by those not indigenous. Those indigenous are mainly elves though some other peculiar and exotic races have been found traversing the land. It cannot be mapped as the landscape is constantly shifting from an unknown force. Due to this the inhabitants learn all the landscapes as biomes and how to traverse them unknowing where the next one will lead.

The main known city of elves, also referred to as the Crimson Gate. A huge city with architecture as if white trees were twisted to become the towering buildings yet still made of stone. The stories say the leaves are dyed crimson as the trees soaked up the blood of those who attempted to reach the Tree of Life.

##### The Heavenfalls

The most known area within Ashtary but only as legend, due to being the place where the Tree of Life was said to have been planted
