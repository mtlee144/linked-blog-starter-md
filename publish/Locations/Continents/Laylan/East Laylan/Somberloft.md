Somberloft is a quaint and enigmatic town that exists on the border between the material realm and The [[Nocturne]]: The Domain of Dreams. The town's borders have melded with the dream plane, allowing dream-like creatures to manifest through a mystical site called the Well. The town's residents have learned to control their dreams or, for the young ones, are carefully monitored and sedated during sleep to avoid the influence of the dream plane's unpredictable manifestations.

Somberloft stands as a unique town at the intersection of dreams and reality. Its disciplined approach to dreams allows its residents to live in relative peace and safety, while the Dreamguard, with their unique abilities, combat any potential threats that arise from The [[Nocturne]]. In this theater of dreams, the people of Somberhaven have found a way to maintain order and harmony amidst the ever-changing landscapes of their imaginations.
