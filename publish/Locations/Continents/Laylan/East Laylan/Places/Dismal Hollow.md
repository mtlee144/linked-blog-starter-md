# Dismal Hollow
#location 

A small village located in a swamp, in which the buildings and walkways are built atop stilts so the structures sit just atop the water. The town is home to a small handful of peaceful warlock humans and was originally settled as a military outpost. 
  

To the south, where the swamp meets the edge of the Gloomfield forest, a tribe of wood elves protect the edge of their forest home from outsiders and are not happy that Dismal Hollow grows in size and population every year.
