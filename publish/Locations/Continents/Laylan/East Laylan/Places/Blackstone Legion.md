Architecture: 3 blackstone towers

§  They, much like the Betrayer Gods, believe that nurturing everybody would eventually lead them to destruction. This doesn’t mean that they leave those who are in need, but rather care well for the poor and unwell.

·  Many [[Minotaur]], Loxodon and Goliath (more individualized folk) live here.

§  East Laylan is known for their mountainous areas rich with minerals, the Blackstone mineral being only found here.

·  Blackstone: An incredibly dense material known to only be forgeable with magic. Deep magical veins shine if infused with magic, the colour varying depending on the user.

·  As it is such a difficult material to forge  the Blackstone Legion were taught by the master craftsmen, [[Dwarves]], whom receive a constant supply even now.

·  The Blackstone legion is quite adept at construction though still not as good as the [[Dwarves]].

§  The symbol of their faction is an onyx colour, with the silhouette of a hammer striking an anvil in front of the Paradian Circle of Unity. As with others united by this Circle the flag is in the style of a stained glass window.
