Home to three witch covens within East Laylan that sit in a tenuous relationship.


### The Witchcrafters
A group of witches who specialise in mixing witchcraft with artistry and craftsmanship. Their wares rival the [[Kingdom of Ix'al|Ix'al]] though buyers should be wary of the price, especially if gold isn't involved.

Led by Madame Nerot, her large witch hat rimmed by candles of different length.

### Fetid Gaze
The three hags of the Fetid Gaze each used powerful illusion magic to hide their true nature, taking on the appearance of stunningly beautiful elven sisters.

They hags would offer their unwary victims some fantastic boon for a price, entrapping them in a bargain from which they could not escape. The unfortunate soul would then be physically trapped within one of the horrific, magically crafted paintings that adorned their walls.

Each member of the Fetid Gaze knew one of the three secret processes required to create their cursed paintings. While the hags all worked together to lure in victims and accumulate greater power, each of them absolutely despised the other two and worked in secret to replace them with their own daughters.

#### Bloody Paintings
There was a fourth hag of the Fetid Gaze coven, one that the other three despised. She was a prodigy; more powerful than all three combined yet gentle and good-natured. From her own blood she created her own  paintings that would grant the buyer a small wish of some kind.

The three despised her and using their powers cursed her paintings to decay, such that her paintings would curse the bearer by coming alive and requiring their blood to continue functioning. 

The witch was hunted down and slain yet her paintings still run rampant, granting gifts in exchange for blood.
