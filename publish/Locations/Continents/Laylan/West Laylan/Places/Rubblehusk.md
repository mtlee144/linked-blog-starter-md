# Rubblehusk
#location 
*Inspired by Bilgewater Riot

Rubbehusk is a port city like no other - home to monster hunters, dock-gangs, indigenous peoples, and traders from across the known world. Over time becoming a vital stop for trade ships travelling near the Serpent Isles*.

Almost anything can be purchased here, from outlawed magic items to the favour of local crime lords. There is no better place to seek fame and fortune, though death lurks in every alleyway, and the law is almost non-existent.

Many shipwrecks and their personnel are brought in by the tides and [[Sethol, The Devourer|Sethol]]â€™s gullet, the people find many of its resources this way.
