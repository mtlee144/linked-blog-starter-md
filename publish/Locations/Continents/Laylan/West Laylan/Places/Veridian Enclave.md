-   They, much like the Cultivator Deities, believe that to nurture others will undoubtedly lead to this same generosity to oneself. This doesn’t mean that they are not willing to fight, but rather sometimes hard truths are what an individual needs to grow and if this means combat then so be it.
    

-    West Laylan is known for the dense [[Paradian Jungle]] where exotic wildlife and plants grow.
    
-   The majority of people of the land are adept at surviving and are sworn protectors of this forest, learning much from the inhabitants.
    

-   The [[Paradian Jungle]] is dense and dangerous, there is no shame in asking for help.
    

-   The people of the Veridian Enclave are much more in tune with magic and thus have a deeper connection with the deep magical essence of the [[Paradian Jungle]] and its being.
    


-   The symbol of this faction is a green emblem, with the silhouette of a deer in front of the Paradian Circle of Unity. As with others united by this Circle the flag is in the style of a stained glass window.
