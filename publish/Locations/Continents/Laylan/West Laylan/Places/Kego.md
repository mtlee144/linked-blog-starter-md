# Kego
#location 

Kego is a lantern lit city across a junction of a river within the [[Paradian Jungle]]. The whole city is built along the large trunks of the trees along this area of the jungle with Japanese Hashi bridges erected between the trees passing over the river.
  

The city is built a ways above the river so as to not disturb the wildlife below and roped pulleys are used to rise to city level. More ropes and grafted stairways around tree trunks are how people move between levels.


The populace has made sure not to carve into the trees and rather have managed to graft their buildings foundations onto and into the trees. A practical form of living off the wild.
