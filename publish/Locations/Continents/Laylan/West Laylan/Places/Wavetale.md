#location 

A resort island off the shores near [[Port Damby]] that was founded from the remnants of an island that was shattered, most likely by the kraken. A combination of the twisted rocks and tunnels made by the tentacles and Ix’al tech has created a unique place where ‘skaters’ cross water and land on bare feet.
