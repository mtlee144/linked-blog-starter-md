#location 
A marble and blackstone settlement situated on the isthmus between East and West Laylan, and uncoincidentally between the two faction settlements. The settlement is the only land travel between the two sides and is in the shape of two large statues shaking hands to form a crossing.

-   Enormous waterfalls surround the crossing making the Paradian Settlement and their stone monument the only way across. This is due to the sea above the Laylan continent being higher than the lower, especially the sea level between the two sides.
    
-   Trees of gold line the highway
    
-   The architecture is open streets, paved with straight ordered buildings.
