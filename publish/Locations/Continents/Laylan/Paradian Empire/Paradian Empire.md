The largest Empire in Adestria, ruled by a single monarch. The Empire was founded in 982PD as two warring factions, the [[Veridian Enclave]] and the [[Blackstone Legion]], fought for control of the continent of Laylan, this conflict came to be known as the [[Second Crown War]].

By the power of the founding ruler Set Paradian and his right hand man Gren [[House Alabaster|Alabaster]], the Paradian Empire overpowered both factions before uniting them under one rule.

Though each faction has vastly different ideologies they manage to coexist together under the Paradian rule.

### Governance
The Paradian Empire is Chaotic Good by nature, striving for the good of the world by unifying everything under its rule.

They function by collecting tithes from villages and factions under their rule as payment for their symbol being allowed to fly there.

##### Current Emperor
The currently reigning monarch of this Empire is [[Mayard Paradian]], the 52nd Emperor since its founding. Known as the 'Child Emperor', at 11 years of age, he exudes an aura of maturity far beyond the norm.

##### The Secret Service
Under the Paradian Emperor's rule is the [[Order of the Ashen Knights]]. A group of individuals blessed with peculiar Ash based magic that gather intel and secretly dispatch enemies of the Empire.

### A Symbol of Unity
The marking symbol of the Paradian Empire is a large golden circle, representing the glorious unity they embody. Easily recognisable this symbol is bestowed upon any place affiliated with the Empire.

### Its Citizens
There are many races that inhabit the Paradian Empire, as it is largely a civilised kingdom but there is a larger demographic of humans that reside in it.

## [[Union Passage]]
The Paradian Empire has a reasonably sized district within each of the two factions' areas but its actual residential area is known as the 'Union Passage'. Situated upon the isthmus that connects the East and West parts of Laylan.

### [[The Magisterium]]
The main arcane institue on Laylan and across Adestria, renowned for its extensive library and breadth of teaching areas.
- Each student wears a pauldron of some make and colour that distinguishes what year and institute they're a part of. 

The university itself floats above the lower level of the [[Union Passage]] at the same altitude to the upper level. It remains chained to the two statues on either side of the waterfall with a single large chain travelling straight down into the centre of the city.

#### Unitum Knights
The most talented knights that graduate from the [[The Magisterium#Dauntless|Dauntless]] training program within [[The Magisterium]] become members of this order of knights.

A single Unitum Knight is said to have the strength of 10 knights.
