#location 

The main institute of higher learning on Laylan and seemingly Adestria, renowned for its extensive library and teaching, anyone who is anyone desires to learn here. 

  

The university itself floats above the lower level of the [[ Union Passage]] and at the same altitude to the upper level, it remains chained to the two statues on either side of the waterfall. A large enchantment has been placed upon it to appear transparent from below.

  

Depending on which institute you desire to become a part of, a different vetting process is undertaken which will often alter the tuition fee in turn.

  

The current Director of The Magisterium is an Autumn Eladrin named Serifaya [[The Lockefall|Lockefall]], who was married to the previous Director, late Thandruin Paradian (a male leonin paladin), who passed away almost 40 years ago. With her trusty secretary Lentark Sharpbeak, a female [[Owlin]], they guide the Magisterium toward greater knowledge and magical prowess.

  

## Campus

The Magisterium itself is split into 5 separate campuses consisting of the Central, Academy, Primal, Esoteria, and Dauntless designated areas. Students will spend the majority of their time on their respective campuses but during downtime and in between classes Central Campus is the hub of university life.

  

Aside from Central and Dauntless, each campus requires the use of a teleportation circle only available to registered students and faculty members, save for the Primals campus which is available for a fee.

  

The Dauntless campus is connected to Central via a well maintained road and bridge where a regular shuttle bus takes recruits to and from. Often you may see recruits in full gear running this route as training or as a punishment. This has lovingly been referred to as ‘The Burn’.

### Central Campus

Central Campus contains all the main ‘open to the public’ facilities, including the [[Siegeball]] arenas and the Citadel of Silver. Venturing up the marble promenade, A fountain monument of Elminster, the Sage beneath a floating arch of rocks marks the centre of campus.![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/v7Vts7igwP5p3S-kxdSSDGGJFX-Q-UCODcMiPAA4RxPTdRs8UNdv4K6Um9PNavfWHFCrIES4ZUFqd1aHPBk-ikxYHJ8LJIK6KMP7ZED9LzhGyGXtSaxDBmc3iUCE8veLgErs5MlPwamZvt36QNlosvo)

  

### Heralds Hall

The main auditorium consists of a large open structure with walls of glass interspersed with marble columns, with a centre stage with [[Tahaanu, god of Heroes|Tahaanu]]’s symbol separating depictions of renowned ‘heroes stories’ along the stage front and Helix stairs along the East and West sides of the hall. Surrounding the centre stage is a series of concentric stairs going up and out.

  

Floating above the stage, just below the ceiling is a large mote of arcane energy like a pale blue sun called ‘Karoz’ with viscous solar flares escaping every so often.

  

Orientation and official graduations are held here, some students come to study within the area as well as administrative things.

  

### Citadel of Silver

An enormous temple made of white silver that marks out the beginning of the Primals campus. The temple is surrounded by a very clear water that filters through and into the Citadel.

  

Within this large stone monument reside 12 sanctums, one for each of the Cultivator Deities and Betrayer gods. Inside, Greco-Roman pillars mark the sides of the hallways with the water from before actually replacing the pathways inside. Individuals can take a small boat to the sanctum they desire, paying a toll if they aren’t a Primal student or choose to wade through waist high water.

  

The sanctums themselves are cylindrical in nature with a large throne in its centre with various symbolism and iconography of that god sparking off from the chair. A gold platform rests at the foot of each throne where devout followers hold rituals and sacrifices if their rituals call for it.

A member of the clergy resides within and takes care of their respective sanctum.

  
  

“I heard the previous director saw it in a dream and believed the gods were telling him to make it.” - An unnamed student

  

### The Run

Beneath the stairs leading from the promenade to the Heralds Hall lies an ‘institution’, a small tuck shop named ‘The Run’. Overseen by Rial Baxtone, a squat dwarf who never graduated from The Academy but is a much loved face on campus. His beard is sentient and helps him prepare the food and drinks, he wears multiple hats at once and is best friends with Herb, and He is known to have all the gossip.
<span class="rightimg"><span class="smallimg">![[Vaults.png]]</span></span>

### Vaults

The most extensive library in Adestria, filled with floating bookshelves, aged tomes that shift in your hands, and twisting walkways.

  

Named Vaults because though students have access to the space, they require staff to locate and give them the requested book or tome from several floating bookshelves. Students from the Academy can take an extracurricular job at the Vaults and become staff.

  

No real fire is allowed within and those who have made that mistake have been banned indefinitely from the Vaults. Students instead have to use Doban lanterns as they have no risk of burning the valuable tomes, those who do not have their own can hire one.

  

### The Hold

Where the people live on campus if they have the money and so choose to. Those enrolled in the Dauntless are given barracks and do not have to pay for their living situation whilst first year Esoteria students live together here before moving into their designated Houses in the second year. Students often make many lasting friendships within The Hold and keep them through Magisterium life and beyond.

  

### Smoulders

Many students who admire craftworks spend much of their time in Smoulders, a series of laboratories and workshops lining one of the ridges of Central campus. Billowing smoke, bright lights, and explosions are often spotted from that side of campus but many continue to sink hours preparing, practising, and perfecting their craft.

  

The Smoulders is taken care of by an ashy [[Minotaur]] named Tustar FoeChuckle who has a strange obsession with lamps, he mutters on and on about a non-magical fuel source that will power an ever glowing lamp. The hobby horse began with Tustar seeking a fuel source that could power just a simple lamp would be the starting point but he’s now too obsessed with them.

  

### The Underring

Within the floating island runs a deep cavernous set of tunnels, the sewers flowing toward the controlled black hole that keeps the island afloat. Kubras keeps this swirling entity under control, hence no one is allowed to enter without express permission from both Kubras and Serifaya.

### [[Siegeball]]

[[Siegeball]] is a large part of the culture at The Magisterium as many disputes between the colleges are settled through games of [[Siegeball]]. So to accommodate for all the students magic and weapons are legal within the games, even lethal magic is usable when targeting the ball.

  

There are 3 arenas on the central campus, with one official size and two slightly smaller that are used for smaller disputes. 

  

The official arena sports two blackstone towers, coloured Goalkeeper areas, white stonewood bleachers along all sides, and two state of the art teleportation pads at each end of the field for players. The Paradian symbol of Unity is set in gold overlapping the neutral zone.

  

The annual [[Siegeball]] tournament is held in Spring during the Union festival before admissions begin. It's a double elimination tournament with the losers brackets taking place on the two smaller arenas. 

There's an exhibition game between the official [[Siegeball]] club at the Magisterium and various spectators that is often more hype than the Finals.![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xky9ExKP3d8p70RciibOH3glxcMT9Wnf3ERiKkf0ztjFfoD8MZjP0O289XFJCal1BDsXnzClrQCJs_1JkVYYqAGfwviDWyiyV4wEiTrsRax6IlT7WQAsiydcvH3-ylVyvHDjQsPXncEsoxW_kvKUiHY)

  

## The Colleges

Students of the Magisterium are driven folk, past the grandeur and renown of the institute itself, those who attend have a clear goal in mind for their education and enrol accordingly.

  

There are few cases of students that come with a desire to attend multiple colleges at once and are allowed to do so, but the workload does not change to accommodate. Those who begin this way often find themselves dropping out from one in pursuit of the other by the end.

### The Academy

Cloistered scholars, magical initiates, talented individuals, and those who seek the mysteries of the arcane find themselves here, hoping to become disciples of and members of [[The Accordance]].

  

Named and sanctioned by them, each school of magic is taught within its walls to varying degrees and eccentricities. Two actual members of [[The Accordance]] remain here, the cloistered Kubras of the Graviturgy school and Adelita the Evocation Master.

  

Admissions to the Academy require a letter of recommendation from a recognized mage or magical school. From there an exam is administered to determine capability and affinity with each of the schools of magic. Commonly an individual will ask to be placed in a specific school based on previous affinity tests, if so the corresponding professor will administer a test of their own.

  

The better the result the less the individual has to pay for yearly tuition often resulting in the aristocracy paying higher on average.

  

These students are then ranked in four categories based on ability and an end of year rank up exam involving a display of parts of their curriculum, they are then referred to with their school of magic and then rank:

-   Spark
    
-   Adept
    
-   Magus
    
-   Wizard
    

  

Note: Spark’s are often derogatorily called Fireflies e.g. “Look at that Illusion Firefly, all bright-eyed and buzzing around”

#### Schools of Magic and their Professors

#### Graviturgy Magic

Kubras Vasiariah, a middle aged Drow with hair like Einstein flowing like seaweed in the wind. He is a member of [[The Accordance]] for the school of Graviturgy and has been since the beginning. When he’s not isolating himself in study he whizzes across campus on his gravity ball, a contraption using bits of runic steel surrounding what looks to be a black hole.

  

His test involves a collection of coloured pebbles of varying size being placed all around the examinee, they must then lift a specific colour off the floor.

  

“Float like a butterfly, sting like a knife. Weighty stuff that…"

  

#### School of Abjuration

Vel’Arauth Ser is an adult Amethyst dragon on the thicker side especially toward the belly, she has a long flat-ish tail like a beaver with several golden sigils marked along his scales. Terrible at remembering names and has long given up, resorting to giving nicknames of the most basic detail of the individual e.g. squat gnome, shaggy human, unkempt elf.

  

Her abjuration test asks the examinee to create a ward upon Vel’Arauth Ser and Adelita will then cast spells of increasing level upon it till it breaks.

  

“A vast knowledge is the greatest barrier.”

  

#### School of Conjuration 

A fun older gnome gentleman named Ipabar Wacklanarall who holds class in random places across the campus, he forces the students to conjure up chairs for themselves else they have to sit on whatever terrain he’s chosen to begin his lecture on, he always makes sure he has the tallest chair.

  

Ipabar’s test requires the examinee to conjure up a hat for Ipabar, the most intricate and creative the better

  

“I know the lava is hot. Stop complaining and make a better chair.”

  

#### School of Divination

Abiathar Asketill is a gruff goliath man from [[Allenthir]] reminiscent of a viking, his eyes resemble the cosmos though he is conventionally blind. With an always fresh buzz cut he meanders across campus, the rattling of the various bones and stones tied to his body let surrounding people know he’s close and to give him room. He also has a small mouse that lives in the hood of his vest named ‘Parmesan’.

  

For the divination test, each of the professors rolls a dice (d10) and hides it under their cup, the examinee will have to identify as many dice rolls as possible. Additionally they can attempt to discern what the hidden item is that replaced one of the dice and which cup it is under.

  

“See past what you can see. Ha ha…”

  

#### School of Enchantment

An old, bald [[Air Genasi]] named Emir from the Kingdom of Ix’al with a long wispy, white beard, he has swirling tattoos across his pale blue body. He wears formal business office attire with a vest similar to ‘Tangerine’ from the movie Bullet train.

  

The enchantment test requires the examinee to project a given image through the ‘Encode Thoughts’ cantrip to Abiathar, he will then describe what he received, the more accurate the better. To up the ante, Arauth Ser will put stronger and stronger wards upon Abiathar.

  

“A poor enchantment is like a leaf in the wind.”

  

#### School of Evocation 

Adelita Fleetfoot is a snow leopard [[Tabaxi]], the tips of her fur have been stained various colours for some reason underneath her wizard’s coat. She is the current evocation master within [[The Accordance]] and spends much of her time sending blasts of elemental magic up into the skies above The Magisterium.

  

Adelita’s test involves the examinee firing off the most powerful spell they can while still protecting the doll next to them.

  

“Evocation magic must always be controlled lest those closest be hurt.”

#### School of Illusion

The Professor of the School of Illusion is an eccentric human named Ulandrin Salter, he’s often aloof and difficult to talk to, often referred to as a space cadet though his eyes give off more than he lets on. His black unkempt hair, oversized professor’s robe, and untied boots mark him out to students as he skips across campus doing who knows what.

  

Ulandrin often doesn’t turn up to his own classes so his assistant Wuvvy, a black female satyr, takes them in his stead. Often she's his stand in during the admissions season as well.

  

When Ulandrin comes he doesn’t do a test but just stares at the examinee very closely before taking them or not.

Wuvvy's test involves manifesting an illusion of an animal accompanied by its sound. The more accurate the better.

  

“...”

“He'll come back to give a comment in a second, I think.” - Wuvvy

  

#### School of Necromancy

M.E.D.I.C is the unofficial professor of the School of Necromancy, a small fire spirit, named Ratchet, in the shape of a salamander sits in the lower abdomen. It was initially created to study the dying on fields of war, after losing function due to an explosion, Ratchet later revived it and they began to pursue necromancy for some reason.

  

M.E.D.I.C's test of necromancy requires the examinee to cast 'animate dead' on several different piles of bones, the more skeletons raised the better and some may not be human.

  

“Necromancy is not for the faint of heart or the weak of willed.”

  

#### School of Transmutation 

Frederick Von Strenheim is an enormous bespectacled bearman who teaches transmutation. His delicate fingers, meek demeanour, and soft speaking has led many to believe he was a human who failed a transmutation spell and ended up as a bearman. He also wears a dapper suit much like Emir.

  

The examinee is given 10 objects of increasing density and must change them into any substance of their choosing for 1 minute before moving on to the next one e.g. sand, wood, metal etc.

  

“The world is not a fixed thing, wield it rather than be wielded.”

  

### Primals

Oathtakers, agents of nature, divine intermediaries, and those who seek the Song of Creation all gather under the banner of Primals.

  

This college has a unique system with no teachers, rather various biomes, temples and auditoriums have been created for individuals to manifest, pray and devote themselves to their crafts. They do have administrative staff and caretakers of these areas instead and some liturgical ‘classes’ are held for those who require communal worship.

  

Despite no official teachers, as many moments of growth within these fields of expertise rely on wise revelation or sparks of conviction, students are assigned two senior students as counsellors. By design, the two counsellors tend to offer conflicting advice, forcing the student to navigate opposing principles and also their own.

  

That being said, a hierarchy within the students does exist based on annual democratic voting within each of the factions. The individuals voted in are given the ‘Ascendant’ title and a corresponding brooch. These persons become representatives and make up half of a council for decision making within Primal matters, the other half being administrative staff. All results from this council are then vetted and approved by the current Director.

  

#### Admissions

Due to the ‘teaching’ being substituted for biomes and worship services the Primal campus is open to the public for a fee and many civilians come to nurture and worship with reasonable restrictions (open from 7am-7pm). Only students who pass the entrance exam, commit and pay for tuition have no restrictions and are provided lodging and food as well as the aforementioned counsellors.

  

Students are also given identifying brooches that they must wear on campus.

  

The exam itself involves a simple request from some of the administrative staff where they are tasked to “Impress us”. The examinee may choose to do so however they choose, perhaps it's with divine magic, a performance of some form, or an exclamation of their convictions. The administrative staff involved will then take a vote. 

  

Each year the student must go through admissions again.

#### The Bestiary

Resting in a central area within the Primals zone connecting to the various biomes, stands The Bestiary, a cultivation sanctuary for all manner of wild beasts that are trained and reared for educational purposes.

  

##### The Dapper Dragon

A tavern that doubles as a hatchery that trains baby dragons to deliver food and drink as well as cook food, each worker is an apprentice dragon trainer. Each drink is based on a type of dragon and is delivered by the corresponding wyrmling. *Students do not receive a discount.

-   Red Dragon 1sp - A fiery drink made using an espresso shot, two shots of a mysterious liquor, several spices and an oil distilled from the chilli plant. Sure enough to set fire to one’s mouth, blood and belly. If you drink it in one shot fire will spew forth from your mouth!
    

  

-   Blue Dragon 7cp - A dark rum with a mysterious glowing blue liquid that doesn’t mix. The liquid has a different flavour with each drink. The next CON save the drinker makes after this one has disadvantaged. 
    

  

-   Green Dragon 6cp - A bubbling green drink that burns on the way down. Anyone who drinks this needs to make a DC15 con saving throw. On a fail they will be knocked out for 10 mins, on a pass, they gain 10 temporary hit points for 10 mins.
    

  

-   Black Dragon 5cp - The standard drink at The Dapper dragon. A dark amber ale with a creamy taupe coloured head, there are small chewable black balls floating inside that when bit into release a tasty, edible but acidic liquid that sizzles the tongue.
    

  

-   White Dragon 4cp - A cold blue milky looking drink tasting of sweet alcohol and mint.A large dollop of ice cream sits on the top. Despite the taste of alcohol it removes all traces inside your body.
    

#### The Greenhouse

An enchanted greenhouse full of peculiar plants but more notably a colony of experimental giant bees. Herb, a wiry black [[Dragonborn]], is the administrator of The greenhouse and has a hobby of making hats. He’s dressed like a mediaeval beekeeper mixed with a wizard and has been breeding a species of bees that could talk, unfortunately his efforts have resulted in a different mutation, these giant bees don’t talk but make special honey from the surrounding plants that have the same effect as medium quality healing potions.

  

“Honeyed hats and broad brimmed bees… or was it the other way round?” - Herb

### Esoteria

Those who aspire for the more scholastic traditions, artificers, numeromancy, archeomancy, alchemy, medicine and more gather within Esoteria

-   No rankings past first year except for seniority of knowledge.
    

  

Students do a year of general studies to lay foundations for the more specialised work to follow in the coming years. They’re encouraged to study broadly so that they become acquainted with a wide range of disciplines.

  

To encourage them to do this broad study and become acquainted with a wide range of disciplines, these first years live in dormitories located on the central campus and often form close friendships there that last throughout their educational careers, even when members of tight-knit groups of friends join different Houses in their second year.

  

Esoteria and Dauntless are the only colleges where students graduate within 4 years and on time.

  

#### Houses

Students within Esoteria are allocated a house based on their alignment which an administrator will ascertain. These identifiers often manifest in different ways for example two Chaotic Good students from Duskhorn within the same field of alchemy, one places high value on creative freedom and attempts to break the boundaries of alchemy so that they may find new solutions whilst the other believes alchemy itself is already chaos as it alters the good of what’s given but is seeking to use it to help those around them. 

  
  
<span class="rightimg"><span class="smallimg">![[StellarWing.png]]</span></span>
##### Stellarwing 

Overseen by Lavinia Stellarwing, a female [[Aasimar]] with an accompanying mascot pixie, the Stellarwings are home to those of a Lawful nature leading many to assume they’re pushovers, little do they know, the pixies’ whimsical nature hides their true intent.

  

Their insignia resembles a small fairy with opalescent wings and is imprinted on their green uniform.

  

##### Winterstar

The House of Winterstar is home to Esoterian students of the Neutral nature who care not for good or evil, doing whatever seems natural. They’re led by A’Tollah Paradian, a frost giant and member of the Paradian <span class="rightimg"><span class="smallimg">![[WinterStar.png]]</span></span>royal family through service, he’s often with several baby yeti’s who he takes care of and love to climb atop him.

  

The Winterstar Insignia is a light blue star/snowflake with two of the side points resembling eyes.

##### Duskhorn

Those of the Chaotic nature find themselves within the House of Duskhorn. Despite their aforementioned tendency toward a chaotic morality there is a longstanding culture of deep respect within Duskhorn for their overseer, K’Falnar [[House Relh|Relh]], a Halfling who is accompanied by his unique shadow hound that bears a horn.

  <span class="rightimg"><span class="smallimg">![[DuskHorn.png]]</span></span>
A side view of a Dark purple Skull Helm with ram horns is the emblem that the Duskhorn use and imprint upon their apparel.

  
  

### Dauntless

Recruits seeking to become a part of the [[Paradian Empire]]’s fighting force find themselves becoming a part of the Dauntless, a fighter’s institution and training facility within the Magisterium. It’s seen as a must if you want to potentially join a squadron in the future. Dauntless training often lasts for 4 years and a placement year in their 3rd year within a squadron for real life experience.

  

Those of the Dauntless don’t necessarily have to be fighters in that regard. Many magic users who don’t seek to study magic but find its use more suited to combat engage well within Dauntless.

  

The admissions is an elaborate obstacle course followed by a separate sparring tournament. Any method is allowed to complete each obstacle which often brings large crowds each year to watch.

“A barbarian continually slams his hammer down at the button, sending a shuttle upward to hopefully ring the bell and pass the test. A rogue slips swiftly past the brute, throwing a knife at the bell directly. A sorcerer glides high above the course and taps it with his hand. The bell rings deftly out as the barbarian roars harder and strikes again.”

  

After the second year, recruits can choose to specialise in one of the four fields led by four experts: 

-   Thomivol Swiftboot, a female Harengon Kensei known as the Weapons master
    
-   Nikken Daniels a rather slim Lizardfolk Rune Knight who handles Grappling
    
-   Kaisa Sol the Firbolg Mastermind Rogue in charge of Strategy and has been dubbed ‘the Commander’. 
    
-   Helaine Shallor, [[Aasimar]] Eldritch Knight and master of war magic.
    

Exceptional soldiers who graduate from the Dauntless training program are sometime enlisted into the '[[Paradian Empire#Unitum Knights|Unitum Knights]]'.

## Paradian Insignia’s

#### Academy Pauldron

Academy students wear a felt pauldron on their left shoulder and dyed in the respective colour of the school of magic they adhere to (mentioned above next to the school). The top lame of the pauldron has a riveted edge of golden metal and an additional lame is added below as their rank increases up to 4 wherein the Paradian symbol of Unity is engraved.

The colours are:

  

-   Graviturgy Magic - Purple
    
-   School of Abjuration - Blue
    
-   School of Conjuration - Brown
    
-   School of Divination - Light Grey
    
-   School of Enchantment - Pink
    
-   School of Evocation - Red
    
-   School of Illusion - Yellow
    
-   School of Necromancy - Dark Green
    
-   School of Transmutation - Orange
    

  

#### Primals Brooch
<span class="rightimg"><span class="smallimg">![[Primals Brooch.png]]</span></span>
Each current student of Primals is bestowed a brooch made from a special variant of blackstone that has had the magical veins moulded to glow a vibrant gold, akin to the Paradian symbol of Unity, when magic is infused.


The brooch itself is shaped like a circumpunct of silver with a backing plate made of the variant blackstone, where the symbol will glow in between the gap created by the silver.

  

Those who become ‘Ascendants’ are given an insert made from a different material each year, shaped like a crescent moon with spokes or feathers adorning the longer side, that fits between the silver circumpunct and the blackstone backing. The year in which they are voted in is engraved upon the back.

#### Esoteria Uniform

A bland cream uniform is given to those who study within Esoteria. Second year Students are given new uniforms similar in design from the previous year but with identifying colours that link them to their respective houses:

-   StellarWing students wear Green with Opalescent parts
    
-   WinterStar wear Cream with Sky Blue tones
    
-   DuskHorn have Grey with Purple 
    

  

#### Dauntless Armour

Recruits who train at Dauntless are the only students who are allowed to wear armour on campus. This is regulated by the institute though and thus all armour is a sturdy leather armour that the students must maintain themselves whilst they attend. Failing to do so will result in 

  

The progression of years doesn’t change this armour but often those who specialise in grappling customise theirs to accommodate for ease of movement. Any changes to the armour will be reverted

## Extracurricular

While a student participates in an Extracurricular, they gain a Student Die and a Relationship Point, as explained below.

  

### Student Dice

Each character gains one Student Die for each Extracurricular they are participating in. A Student Die is a d4 the player can roll and add to an ability check that the character makes, provided the check uses one of the skills listed in the Extracurricular’s description. The player can wait until after rolling the d20 before rolling the Student Die, but must do so before you say whether the check succeeds or fails. No more than one Student Die can be rolled per check. After rolling a Student Die, a player can’t roll it again until the character finishes a long rest.

  

### Relationship Point

While a student participates in an Extracurricular, the student gains either a positive or a negative Relationship Point (the player’s choice) with one student NPC who is also a member of the Extracurricular.

  

While a character has 2 Relationship Points or more with a student NPC, that NPC becomes a Friend, and the character receives a Bond Boon from that person as long as the NPC is a Friend.

  

While a character has −2 Relationship Points or less with a student NPC, that NPC becomes a Rival, and the character receives a Bond Bane from that person as long as the NPC is a Rival.

  

Bond Boons and Bond Banes are noted in each NPC entry in the “Fellow Students” section. When a character makes a Friend or a Rival, the player should note it on their tracking sheet.

  

At any time during the adventures in this book, a character can end their friendship with an NPC, effective immediately. When they do so, that character’s Relationship Points with the NPC reset to 0.

  

### Quitting an Extracurricular

Characters can quit an Extracurricular at any time, updating their tracking sheet accordingly. When a student quits an Extracurricular, they immediately lose its benefits. If a character quits during an adventure, you might want to roleplay the situation, since NPCs are likely to take an interest in why the student is leaving.

## Jobs

Working in gainful employment while at school can provide a character with a modicum of cash and help forge connections with student coworkers.

  

### Getting or Losing a Job

A character can hold one Job at a time, and they can participate in only one Extracurricular while they have a Job. A student can switch Jobs whenever they wish, even in the middle of the academic year, as long as they don’t work more than one Job at a time. At your discretion, switching Jobs in the middle of the year might lead to a roleplaying scenario.

  

### Job Benefits

While a student has a Job, they earn a wage and a Relationship Point, as explained below.

  

### Wage

A student who works a Job gains 5 gp at the start of each week that they hold the Job. If a student quits during the academic year, they stop earning this money at the end of the week in which they quit.

  
  

### Relationship Point

While a character works a Job, they gain a positive or negative Relationship Point (the player’s choice) with one student NPC at that Job. This represents a coworker with whom the character is often scheduled and with whom they can easily form a connection (see the Relationship rules later in this chapter).
