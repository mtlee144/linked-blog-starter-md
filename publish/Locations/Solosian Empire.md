#Worldbuilding 

Solos, the capital of the ancient Solosian Empire, a city that was built atop several leylines across the one continent of Laylan and the North parts of Mahra Coulta, a bastion of hope for mortal races in the ancient monster filled era of [[The Age of Conduits]].

These leylines provided large quantites of magical energy that could fuel powerful abjuration magic that reinforced the city walls - the ruins of these walls largely still stand upon the Mahra Coulta, even dipping down into the sea.

### A Long Forgotten History
It's unsure when the Solosian Empire began its reign and the history presented on the walls of ruins found don't do much to help this due to several different art styles and architectures that encompassed this Empire.

The reason scholars believe they are all a part of the same Empire of Solos is due to the lines of kings and passage of time detailed across the history. Though the art styles are vastly different the marking of events, the sequence and passage of time between them are fairly consistent e.g. a certain Emperor's coronation, war, betrayal, and successor in an inked art style from a Laylan site might match with a separate ruin on Mahra Coulta that uses a geometric engraved style.

The only written record of any event from the Solosian Empire is its destruction, thus the [[History of Adestria]] dates itself counting back toward that as the start of modern history.

### Technologically Advanced
Spanning across multiple continents, this Empire was incredibly large, sporting technologies way beyond what is understandable now - it is believed that the many colonies within the [[Kingdom of Ix'al]] are derived from the remnants of this land, their unique magics a shadow of what the Empire held. Most notably the secrets of the [[Warforged]]'s creation process originated from the Solos.

The reason the northern parts of Mahra Coulta are habitable at all are due to the Solosian Empire's ability to terraform the frigid wasteland there. Tremendous mechanical pumps have been found in the area that lead into a complex array of water bodies that the city of [[Allenthir]] use as their water supply. These complex machineries have been undecipherable despite their ability to continue moving the water, many believe it to be an ancient magic that continues to run these aqueducts yet no one has been able to uncover what kind.


#### Sol
The current theory for the mysterious Empire's technology is based around what they believe is a 'battery' of some sort commonly referred to as a 'Sol'. These components come in various shapes to accomodate the technology it powers, the only distinguishing feature is the brilliant blue that it emits when both sunlight and magic are infused.

#### Relic Hunters
Solos relics fetch a pretty penny, some even a fortune if they are still in working order and many commit their lives to searching out these treasures whether to sell them or understand more of this lost Empire - they call themselves Sol Hunters.

### Religion
Based upon the iconography found in ruins like the [[Sands of Doom#Temple of Emon, god of Death Kirat|Temple of Kirat]], they worshipped many of the gods heralding the Arch-Conduits within their midst as legitimate progenitors of the deities. 

Their main worship centres around [[Belial, The Judge]] being the de-facto ruler of the Pantheon. Solosian Empire history seems to hold the fact that several of the gods dwelled with them though their influence brought to the people through their Arch-Conduits.

This devotion was reflected in their architecture on both continents, differing slightly in motif despite the multitude of art styles, it is believed that on Laylan they worshipped Shakhor whilst on the continent of Mahra Coulta they took after Lavan. 

#### Dragons
Many dragons are believed to have made their den in this kingdom, working with the people in some kind of community. At the Empire's destruction they were sent into the earth.

### Destruction
Records within Solosian ruins depict the last Solosian Emperor, an arch-conduit of Ollon, decided that the meddling of the gods in mortal dealings was causing too many issues, and tried to sever the connection between the material plane from the upper and lower planes, obliterating himself and his Empire.

### Dragon Age
Since the city was unprotected, some really powerful dragons decided that its riches were an all you can get buffet and jumped in the opportunity to pillage it. The remaining court mages could not stop them from doing this, but they could at least help the remnants of the empire not to suffer the same fate and "reversed" the magic on the walls to keep the dragons in, making it a jail for them.
