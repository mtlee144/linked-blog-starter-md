A reflection of the Material Plane suffused with potent magic and unbridled emotion, the Feywild exists in the corner of the eye, an echo as one turns their head quickly, resting just beyond reach yet tantalisingly close.
- [[Norn, god of Art|Norn]] created the Feywild purely as a joke, a mockery of the [[Issylra, goddess of Shadows|Raven Queen]]’s realm, the [[Shadowfell]]. 

Many have sought to traverse its glades and fields only to have their wits lost, time stolen and body’s warped. Landmarks may resemble the Material though mountains stand straighter, rivers clearer and flowers more bright; memory and distance cannot be trusted just as equally as the inhabitants.

  

The faeries themselves are inherently lazy, living amidst a realm that cares not for time or consistency; they seek new and exciting ways to amuse themselves. Fairies are so often drawn to the material world due to this, a land wrought by time, with entities that seek fame and fortune for only a couple centuries if even that, and then disappear leaving nary a trace they existed.

  

Other humanoid creatures that stem from the Feywild are essentially abstractions of creatures present on the Material Plane, altered by the wild forces of the Fey, that have strayed for unknown reasons.

  

The courts of the Fey rule over aspects of life and the magic within it. Many believe that contact with the Fey will result in your soul being taken and this might be true for some, but rather it's the intricacies of temporal life that draw them in.

  

#### The Bl'mynia

“The crackling of fire, waves breaking against the shoreline, as morning sun drifts across a resting arm, lightning strikes illuminating the Bloom in the sparks”

  

Commonly referred to as ‘The Bloom’ this court represents aspects of summer, light, and fire. They have a nasty habit of abducting creatures from the material plane and ‘growing’ them as statues.

-   Red and yellow
    

  

#### The Aurelie

“The Aurelie are the sound of crisp leaves under foot, a change in the wind bringing a brisk sharpness, a harvest of hidden abundance concealing the rot inside.”

  

These fey are a strange cacophony of creatures that represent autumn, change, and peace .They wear venetian masks that magically disguise their form and suppress their emotion with ensembles that resemble Autumn.

-   Gold and Auburn
    

#### The Wysenthra

“Within the sound of falling snow, peppermint frost within puffs of smoke, an owlbear begins its final rest under the watchful eye of the Wilted.”

  

Colloquially the Court of Wysenthra is referred to as ‘The Wilted’, representing winter, death, and decay.

-   Silver and lavender
    

  

#### The Floress

“A child giggles as it plays beneath the trickling waterfall, guided by the allure of the Floress, earnest delight unaware of its mother now fertilising the plants below.

  
  

The Spring Court represents new beginnings, transformation, and the cycle of life. 

The citadel is like a horizontal helix with people walking in any orientation
