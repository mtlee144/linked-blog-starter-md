The Underdark is a vast network of tunnels and caverns below the surface of Adestria. Despite it's size, the unknown dangers it presents make it difficult for many to venture far into its depths. 

Mainly without any source of light save for the occasional luminous rocks or fungi. Large portions of it are also without food or water, making well-stocked food supplies a must-have when exploring uncharted terrain underground.

#### Subterror
There exist within each domain of the Underdark, 8 dragons known to the natives as 'Subterror Behemoths'.
To the inhabiitants of the Underdark, surviving and effectively hiding from these 'calamities' is a higher priority than finding food to eat.

They are as follows:
1. Stalagmo - its body is made of stone and black mucus that flows out from areas that appear to be its joints. Once that liquid gets hold of your body there is no way to evade its attack.
2. Voltelluric - creating thunder clouds as it glides through the Underdark, a feat not many creatures can do with the stagnant air that exists here
3. Umastryx - Digging through the ground with its horn and claws it uses its whiskers to make up for its poor eyesight. This dragon is believed to be the cause of all earthquakes across Adestria.
4. Ultramafus - Volcanic ash paints the area gray, anything that comes into contact with this dragon melts. [[The Ashen King]] keeps this dragon as a pet.
5. Stygokraken - The lord of the lake lurks in the cold deep of the Underdark, camouflaged in its water the last thing people see are its four horns that emit light as it pounces.
6. Phospheroglacier - An ice dragon with a glowing sphere on its torso, fascinated by its glorious appearance many have lost their lives getting too close to it.
7. Dragossuary - A wicked dragon that continues to move even in death. One legend remarks that the sound of bells were heard as it roared before eating all in its path. Necronomo is taking care of this one.
8. Speleogeist - Formerly known as the King of dragons but banished to the Underdark, this creature has not been seen or heard of in centuries.

#### [[The Ashen King]] 
Ruler of the Underdark
  
#### [[Outer Mortia]]
A crime city within the Underdark run by three organisations that keep each other in a tenuous balance.

#### The Gloom
A large forest full of large, iridescent fungi that glows brightly every few minutes.

  
#### The Sunless Sea
A large portion of the Underdark is covered by deep dark waters full of aberrations. The inhabitants of this area have built stone structures and walkways like stalactites so as to risk sailing across the waters below spells death.


#### Necronomo
A lich/necromancer who is robbing graves from below and turning them into an undead army. His fort looks like a giant tree hanging from the ceiling. Skeletons hang from vines that he’s using to feed on. 


#### The Raafi
A druidic tribe called the Raafi, they wear earthy coloured baggy clothing and live between the underdark and the surface. They grow mushrooms on their bodies.
