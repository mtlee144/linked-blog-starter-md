In the city of Outer Mortia, a golden age built on vice and blood is in it’s 100th year of prosperity. The city’s towering skyscrapers and opulent lounges serve as vantage points for the city’s elite to gawk at the beating heart of their capitalist machine of a city. 

The city’s luxuries and contraband would not have been so easily funded if it weren’t for the three crime families that operate in the shadows. The families keep the elite’s pockets lined and the machine well-oiled. 

### Crime Families
#### Nautilica Syndicate
Chief amongst these families is the Nautilica Syndicate in the City’s uppermost Cloud district. They are the oldest mob family lead by the enigmatic [[Don Abyssmus]], an ancient Mindflayer who has built his empire on smuggling prohibited liquor and hired thuggery. 

There are four lieutenants within this syndicate:
- Skolus - Female High Elf
- Ogmeister - 
- [[Drogon Abyssmus]] - 
-

#### Sun On Moon
The city’s middle ward is controlled by the Sun On Moon Triad. The dragonborn Triplets consisting of Dai Lous Yi, Song and Wu lead their syndicate in smuggling illicit substances throughout the city, chief among them is the designer drug: Dragon Dust. 

#### Arroyo Cartel
The undercity is the home turf of the Arroyo Cartel. Padre Benicio operates out of a long since desolate church which his operation uses as a front to spread the blasphemous gospel of the Angel of Marais. Behind the scenes the cartel smuggles in illegal weaponry and explosives, supplying firepower to those that can afford such vicious tools of destruction. 



### City Government and Police
The city is run by the corrupt Mayor [[Jezebel Firehart]] and her coffers are kept full with the money supplied by the families. However, her daughter, the young upstart politician[[ Eliza Firehart]] aims to purge the corruption away from the office and has the backing of many of the working class. 

The OMPD is kept in line by Mayor Firehart and is kept wilfully ignorant of the families’ businesses. The police are instead more of a hired militia that serves to extort the working class and ensure that the public remains intimidated by the iron rule of Firehart and the families. 

Chief [[Sebastion McBastion]] controls an intimidating force of trained policemen and in times of crisis can even command the city’s old defence system known as the Valkyrie program. The Valkyries are husks of the angels that used to watch over the city. These husks are now powered up by infernal magic that compels them to serve and protect the mayor’s interests at all costs.

Although the police are kept in line by the corruption, sometimes criminals need to be made an example of and no amount of purse-lining will keep a blacklisted crook out of the city’s gargantuan maximum-security prison, The Inverted Spire.

#### Gumshoes
There are still some individuals that refuse to be bought out by the corrupt system and choose to serve their own brand of justice in OM. These select few private investigators are known as the Gumshoes. They act as detectives for hire that act as the closest thing to a justice system in OM.
Gumshoes can either come from a PI agency or are elusive individuals that prefer to act alone. Whichever it is, if a Gumshoe is on the case, be assured that it is only a matter of time before the truth is revealed to all.

#### The Kane Brothers
The Kane Brothers are a new faction to the city. Raised from the slums and clawed their way up to the top of the cloud district

Nobody knows how they made their fortune from the bottom but everyone knows that the two brothers leave nothing but blood and bone in their wake

### The Inverted Spire
Shaped like an upside down cone, drilled into the depths of the floor of the Underdark.
