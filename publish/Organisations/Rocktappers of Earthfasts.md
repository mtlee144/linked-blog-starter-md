#Organisations 
A group of people who believe that since [[The Creator]] made everything than that would include rocks and therefore gems and ores have powers that are waiting to be awakened.

This organisation is actually quite large and serious, their ventures into the [[Underdark]] and geological studies have helped elucidate many understandings of 'blackstone' and its effects, thus allowing the relocation of the [[Blackstone Legion]] to its current home.

They consisted largely of lone prospectors, fur trappers, and other mountain folk, and were often hermits or outcasts of mainstream society. Their numbers were highly variable and difficult to estimate, and fluctuated as new people ventured into mountains, old members gave up and returned to civilization, and others died in the wilderness. They formed a very loose and disconnected group and always traveled alone. However, they left signs and supplies for fellow Rocktappers, not out of a real desire to aid one another but to ensure that they themselves could be similarly aided in future.

There is a group of these people that have made a club at [[The Magisterium]].
