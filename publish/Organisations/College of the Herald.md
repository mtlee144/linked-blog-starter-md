#Organisations 
The Heralds, or Those Who Herald, is a semi-secret organization dedicated to preserving historical lore, maintaining the balance between nature and civilization, and defending the innocent from the forces of evil across Adestria.

	"From Light's Embrace to Shadows Deep. A world to save, an oath to keep."

The main focus of the Heralds is to collect and preserve knowledge of ancient history, legends, heraldry, and folklore, and to make it available for those of good and peaceful intentions. For that reason, most Heralds study at a College of Lore and practice its methods. 

Throughout the many years it has endured, the Heralds have publicly disbanded and fallen apart several times, only to reform later in some new iteration.

Despite its united focus, the organisation has no hierarchy or governing body, the only thing keeping order is their beliefs and tenets to preserve history.

#### Branches
There are two main branches of the Heralds each performing their sacred duties in as much tandem as the generally disorganised group can do. 

##### The Herald's Oath 
Sworn upholders and defenders of the true Lore, these oathtakers serve as Paladins that hone their skills to defend the sanctuaries and libraries where Those Who Herald find solace. Many who take this oath believe that the preservation and perpetuation of the true Lore will allow the inhabitants to strike against the forces of evil in the most effective way possible.

	"Keep our swords and tempers sharp for we fight when we must or die doing so. Yet a quiet word or a skillful deal will turn a fright enemy just as quick. This is the true Heralds way: subtle and quiet, trust and wisdom."

##### Order of the Herald and Harp
This branch of Those Who Herald are bards of some form and are often called 'Harpers'. As procurers and knowledge holders they sought to learn the trade of barding as a means of passing down precise information through memorizing tradition and lore. 

	"That's why so many Heralds are Harpers and bards: to preserve the knowledge of the past"

This practice is so the content of the libraries and monuments that hold original lore are still able to be passed down through word of mouth, as songs that will forever be remembered even as other memories fade.

#### Keepers
Deep within the intertwining of this organisation lay a few gifted individuals known as Keepers. Born with an extraordinary mind that can remember anything and everything they set it to these individuals are what ultimately keep the Lore consistent together.

It is believed that several Keepers were the ones who started the organisation, seeking to create a widespread populace of likeminds to protect them from their persecution.

Due to the rarity and importance of a Keeper their identity is kept secret and only one another Keeper will know of their existence, that being their mentor. 

Additionally they are all trained extensively to protect their knowledge if all else fails.
