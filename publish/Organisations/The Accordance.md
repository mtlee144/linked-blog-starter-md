#Organisations 

Established toward the end of [[The Age of Conduits]] after an event known as the [[Eve of Crimson Midnight]].

Centuries later, one mage known now as [[Arkan, The Arisen|Arkan]] the Risen set forth from them to reach new and greater heights.

Currently the members of the Accordance are left to their own devices, some teaching, some political figures and some cloistered scholars but all still answer the call to meet and confer 'peacefully' on world shattering matters by the magical order to disallow [[Arkan, The Arisen|Arkan]]’s guidance to happen again.

Established toward the end of [[The Age of Conduits]] after an event known as the [[Eve of Crimson Midnight]].

Centuries later, one mage known now as [[Arkan, The Arisen|Arkan]] the Risen set forth from them to reach new and greater heights.

Currently the members of the Accordance are left to their own devices, some teaching, some political figures and some cloistered scholars but all still answer the call to meet and confer 'peacefully' on world shattering matters by the magical order to disallow [[Arkan, The Arisen|Arkan]]’s guidance to happen again.

They seek to meet once a year but often this is overruled by their work and if there isn't any impending issue they will often miss the meeting.
