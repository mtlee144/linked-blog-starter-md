#Organisations 

Acquisitions Incorporated is an adventuring company from the coast of Broker's Grove. The organization consists of several groups of adventurers for hire that act more or less independently under the company's charter.

The company operats by providing a network of support infrastructures for adventuring groups, which are referred to as franchises. Each franchise is licensed to operate within a certain region, which can be expanded depending on the success of its endeavors. It is not uncommon for different franchises to compete over territory and exclusivity rights. In exchange, the organization's Head Office holds the right to commission its franchises to engage in priority missions.

Support from Acq Inc's Head Office is provided in several instances, such as the establishment of a local headquarters, a staff of trained hirelings, and an assortment of magic items provided to adventurers in accordance to their position within the franchise. All these features increase in influence and power as the franchise prospers.

#### Founding
The company was founded by the cleric Omin Dran as part of his efforts to find his sister Auspicia, who had gone missing after an incident in a ruin near Red Larch. Over time, the company expanded its activities and became a large for-profit adventuring outfit

#### Popular Franchises
There are several franchises that have a wide range of operations and are commonly utilised across Adestria, they are often coloquially named Sectors followed by a number.

##### Lizards of the Coast
A franchise that has created two hit tavern games across Laylan, [[Dungeon Monsters]] and [[Onions and Flagons]]. They are currently attempting to expand into Mahra Coulta but the lack of contact between the colonies of the [[Kingdom of Ix'al]] have made it difficult, currently they've only established within [[Arlingford]].


##### Sector 1 - Acquisition and Deliveries
This franchise is known for their priority and ability to secure goods and transport them to a destination safely and securely. They are currently utilised across all of Laylan and have recently expanded into the southern region of Mahra Coulta. 

Sector 1 can be a little expensive but for goods that are worth the security the money is well spent. 

##### Sector 2 - Corporate Sales
Though the [[Holy Guild of Belial]] has a large monopoly on transactions and neutrality, the religious shadowing can often rub merchants of a certain kind the wrong way, thus Sector 2 is often called in.

Whether this transaction is seedy or not, they are ultimately cheaper than the [[Holy Guild of Belial#Clergyman|Clergyman]] of the [[Holy Guild of Belial]] and are often seen in less affluent areas.

##### Sector 3 - Hunter's Contract
For many, the hunting of a certain monster is above their pay grade so many look to the monster hunters of Sector 3. The contract they employ is a binding vow that promises success or transferral to a parallel team if the current party is unable to complete it.

For the right price, any monster will be hunted down for whatever reason. The fee is dependent on death of the creature or just a collection of a certain part.

##### Sector 4 - Cleaners Incorporated
An up and coming franchise licensed by Acquisitions Incorporated that seeks to complete your odd jobs, regardless of what they may be. They boast an efficient and 'No questions asked' policy that has brought them recent success across Laylan.
