#Organisations 
A Cult that worships Sentient weapons and their makers, [[Issylra, goddess of Shadows|Issylra]] and [[Karthor, god of Fire and Forge|Karthor]]. Many of the weapons of the Living Flock weren’t divine or holy as much as houses and prisons for malevolent spirits who suddenly had a little too much authority.
- They’re attempting human sacrifice to weapons believing that by doing so they can lock the soul in and create more sentient weapons as their Betrayer Gods are no longer physically on Adestria and cannot create more.

### [[The Forged War]]
Their forces numbered significantly larger during the [[The Age of Conduits]] and are major participants of [[The Forged War]] - a war between their members and the colonies of the [[Kingdom of Ix'al]].
