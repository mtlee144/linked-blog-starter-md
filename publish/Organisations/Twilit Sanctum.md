#Organisations 
Originally a Circle of Moon Druids but now includes Clerics, Paladins, and Rangers, these people worship [[Iora, goddess of the Moon|Iora]] the goddess of the moon. Their main tasks are to protect her wildlife and keep peace for all ages. 

Often they’ll take pilgrimages to [[Iora, goddess of the Moon|Iora]]’s Fell, a lake reminiscent of a moon in several phases on the western side of West Laylan, to meditate in the hopes of being blessed by her. 

They currently reside in and are the progenitors of [[Kego]]. As the druids gathered to spectate and to guard the Deer, many others came to pay their respects and over the years it grew to a city of its own accord.
