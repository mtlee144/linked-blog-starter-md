The disciples of this monastic tradition are based along the northern side of the Doban range. Utilising long pole arms with large blunt hooks on the end shaped like ram horns and large fur clothing they vault up the mountainside similar to mountain goats.

A natural ascetic order they live off what they can forage for in the mountains and tend to and protect the [[Berry Ram]] that are farmed for their meat. 
- They are currently attempting to make for the Glory range on East Laylan to stop the farm there.

They get their name from a joke about the natural Iron that they incorporate into their pole arm and coat, and defenders of the unique wildlife there they are ferocious and stalwart.

	"Just like the Berry ram's coat resembles what they eat, they must eat only iron. No wonder they can't take a joke."
