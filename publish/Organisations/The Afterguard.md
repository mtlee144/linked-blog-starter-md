#Organisations 
An order of outriders and morticians who follow a set of old scrolls prescribing that ALL dead are supposed to be properly sent off into the afterlife. The Afterguard is a fabled regiment made up of Trackers and Handlers who survey the wilderness on horseback to make sure every corpse is retrieved and properly sent off.

### The Scrolls
Located in 1945PD, this set of scrolls dictate that all humanoids require a proper death lest [[Emon, god of Death|Emon]] send them to the pits of the afterlife or bring them back as Undead.

To aid the authenticity of these scrolls, [[Emon, god of Death#Chimes|A bell of Emon]] was found attached to the main doctrinal scroll. This bell acts as a radar toward corpses and sometimes even those who are about to become one.


### Organisation
The Afterguard have a base of operation 

Though the organisation is sparse in members, parties travel in groups of three: An Officer, a Regent, and a trainee.

#### Handlers
The leader of each expedition group, trained in combat and liturgy to perform the burial rites. They carry small replicas of the [[Emon, god of Death#Chimes|Chime]] that is used during the burial.


#### Trackers
A member of the Afterguard ministry trained in detecting the bodies of deceased humanoids and those that have become Undead. Many are Rangers and Clerics for this purpose.

#### Trainee
An acolyte training to become either a Handler or a Tracker
