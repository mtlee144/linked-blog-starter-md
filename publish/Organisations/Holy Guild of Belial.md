#Organisations 
This guild began as a church in [[The Age of Conduits]] honouring and worshipping the two suns. As time went on and into Post Divergence, the organisation became more and more affluent as parties would pay clergy to be neutral judges in regard to law and merchanting affairs. As a result the church became more akin to a guild as greedy merchants drew toward it. The Holy Guild of [[Belial, The Judge|Belial]] now serves as official judges when concerning legal matters and merchant issues.

- Many merchant clerics and some paladins serve here.

### Clergyman
Devout followers of [[Belial, The Judge|Belial]] and his church can become clergy or official ministers of the Holy Guild and that is their position first and foremost, to uphold the doctrine and theology of the church before other things.

In addition, those who have attained the right to become clergy of the Holy Guild choose between three areas to herald. This area is shown by an earring with a distinctive symbol that represents their area of expertise and can be connected to form one piece, this mechanism is used to distinguish between fakes and real ones as authentic jewellry will click and merge seamlessly to form one unified symbol until a magical keyword is spoken.

For each area there are two High Priests each who serve together.

#### Lavanor
Those who take up the mantle of Lavan seek to deal with the merchanting of daily affairs of the one continent of Laylan as is where their authority is respected and acknowledged.

#### Shakhoran
Others become known as Shakhorans, magic dealers, that are experts in arcane artefacts and scrolls, choosing not to exchange the non-arcane.

#### Judges of Bel
The third area are the Judges of Bel who act as neutral judges across Laylan and some parts of Mahra Coulta like [[Arlingford]] and [[House Doban]]. 

Those sanctioned by the Guild as Judges of Bel have a unique identifiable scale that uses a black goblet and white goblet to weigh either side.
