#Organisations 
A thieves guild posing as an organisation that trains cooks allowing them to get into almost anywhere. 
On the outside they teach cooking at a high level, its qualifications opening doors into high end taverns and noble houses. Majority of members pass with this qualification, unaware of its hidden purpose.

Deeper within the organisation specific personnel are vetted if they show promise in thieving using certain cooking tests e.g. knife skills, stealing/pinching ingredients from other tables, their dialect of thieves cant is a code that exists within recipes.

Only those who make it to the final stages are made aware of the purpose and are then taught tactics of espionage. 

#### Pilgrimages
Every member of The Cookery must take an internship at certified restaurants to gain real life experience.

Those who are admitted into the 'rogue' area of The Cookery made to do a secondary pilgrimage across several locations. This includes receiving a hidden order found within a recipe given them by a mentor and having to carry out specific duties.
