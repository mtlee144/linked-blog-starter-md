Adestria has two suns, one white and one black that are in constant orbit of each other. The white sun known as Lavan is believed to grant known life and light to Adestria whilst the black sun, Shakhor, is believed to grant all magic. <span class="rightimg"><span class="smallimg">![[Shakhor.png]]</span></span>

They orbit the plane of Adestria with contrary ellipses resulting in celestial phenomena such as:

-   Nimbus eclipse - is a phenomenon once every 8 months where Lavan and Shakhor overlap one another
    

-   Black Nimbus - Lavan overlapping Shakhor resulting in a black ring in the sky. The whole hour has the sky turn a deep violet but magic feels like it’s not working.
    
-   White Nimbus - Shakhor overlapping Lavan resulting in a white ring with a black hole in the middle. The whole hour looks like sunset yet all constellations in the sky are incredibly visible.
    

  

Adestria also has one pale blue moon, Yerah, that orbits the plane and is heralded for keeping the suns in check by balancing out the sky despite being smaller and outnumbered.

There are also certain eclipses that involve Yerah:

-   Umbral Shakhor - Yerah idles in front of the black sun Shakhor, a deep and dark blue enveloping the sky for two hours. Many believe the cultivator gods are at their most powerful and able to be communed with.
    
-   Crimson Lavan - Yerah idles in front of the white sun Shakhor, a crimson sky is created and many believe the Betrayer gods are at their strongest for two hours.
