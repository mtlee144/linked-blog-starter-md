Native to the Golden Hills of West Laylan, a Pumpkin Toad is roughly 12-13 inches long with orange skin and a mainly smooth texture to it. 

The Pumpkin Toad is known for hiding within pumpkin patches where it will inflate itself to roughly the size of a small/medium pumpkin and stalk any sort of insects or small animals that would attempt to eat the pumpkins. This gives the pumpkin toad a fine relationship with the Pumpkin plants as well as the farmers that tend to them.
