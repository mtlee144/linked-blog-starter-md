A large black moth whose wings create an image of a white skull when resting. Terrifying but actually one of the most affectionate creatures on Adestria. The dust from their wings can be sprinkled on a body that will prevent it from rotting for up to 12 months.

The [[Underdark]] lich [[Underdark#Necronomo|Necronomo]] in the [[Underdark]] uses these.
