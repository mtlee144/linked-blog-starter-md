A breed of ram thatâ€™s sole diet is that of a certain kind of berry e.g. strawberry ram, blueberry ram. This has caused their meat to take on the colour and flavour of the berry consumed, and are farmed for it as a delicacy. Their coat often reflects the colour as well and is shorn as a natural colouring for fashion as compared to fabrics dyed separately.

The [[Brotherhood of the Iron Rams]] seek to protect their natural habitat upon the Doban Range.

There is a reknowned farm on the Glory Range.
