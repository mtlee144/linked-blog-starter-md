#Worldbuilding 

What may look like a school of fish is actually a growth of The Grasp, the stem off this plant is as thin as fishing line and covered in hooked barbs, if you are ever caught in this plant your best course of action is to go limp, as the more you struggle the more barbs attach. Once entangled the creature then slowly starved and then digested.
