#### Necrotic Tempest

A furious and amorphous storm, viscous heaps of ash swirling and igniting necrotic thunder due to the friction. Creatures ending their turn in the storm take 8d8 necrotic damage. Any creature that dies during this storm will rise again as a zombie.

  
#### Emotional Echo

Occurs in locations where intense emotions have been felt, like a battlefield or graveyard. A creature must make a DC16 CON saving throw or be heavily impacted by the rampart emotions. Depending on the emotion they may be swept up and experience the situation in which the emotion was initially felt e.g. striking at whomever is closest as if they’re on a battlefield, becoming catatonic 


#### Primal Fruit

In wild places brimming with nature’s power, gardens meticulously tended by eccentric wizards, and blessed groves touched by divine providence, plants can sometimes produce fruit bursting with primal magic.
