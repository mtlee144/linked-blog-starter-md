A walking emotional echo known by many names - The tyrant King, the lonely, the Multitude.

Originally a noble elf of [[Ashtary]] beckoned to be a conduit for [[Ashtar, The Protector|Ashtar]] [[Ashtar, The Protector|the protector]]. Yet due to his intensely strong ego he was not chosen causing a torrent of emotions that fractured his personality.

Though these personalities are split with each being an embodiment of an intense emotion, they all believe one thing, that the Pantheon of Adestria held two more gods: him and his wife (the god of Love and Lies), hence the title Lord of lies.

He is also responsible for unleashing [[The SpellPlague]] and bringing it to [[Ashtary]] in the hopes of using it against the Elves.

During [[The Weeping War]] upon [[Ashtary]] he led his army of followers through to his home of [[Ashtary]].
