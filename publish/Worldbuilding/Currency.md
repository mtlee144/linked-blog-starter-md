There are two types of common currency used across Adestria

#### Paradia

This is the commonly used currency across the majority of Adestria. Initially coined by the [[Paradian Empire]] seeking to unify the economy under one currency, it functions like normal D&D money. 

-   Platinum - A large coin similar to silver but shinier with a golden border creating the Paradian symbol of Unity. This coin is equivalent to 10 gold pieces.
    
-   Gold - A similar sized coin made of gold. This coin is equivalent to 10 silver pieces
    
-   Silver - A smaller sized coin made of silver. This coin is equivalent to 10 copper pieces.
    
-   Copper - The smallest coin made of copper.
    

  

#### Ix’en

A currency that circulates the colonies of Ix’al, each a magical stone imbued with elemental energy and equivalent to each other though not exchangeable for each other. This is because despite having the same value based on weight, there is prejudice between colonies and their currency used so vendors will make you pay extra using a different currency to the primary colony.

-   8 flame Ix’en for a longsword could theoretically be traded using 8 gale Ix’en since they are the same cost, one may end up paying 10 gale Ix’en instead.
