#CampaignOne

### Expectations
We commit to a regularly scheduled session every 2 weeks
- Gives me time to prep
- Gives you more freedom with busy schedules
- The worry is if we miss a session it'll be a month before the next one but that's already better than what we do now.
	- We can take a break if that is required or things are super hectic but I'd like to have it scheduled in people's calendar's every two weeks

This would be a wonderful thing to get set up since I'll be heading to China for a year and want to regularly see you and keep playing this campaign.
- Aside from my own poor planning when it came to the creating the last campaign it was difficult to stay motivated when we went months without anything

#### Adestria
This is a world I built for you guys not myself, I'd love it if you wanted to invest and make things for it.
- Create your own city that evolves within the world
- I'd love to have you guys use it for one shots, make your own something something

It's partly why the setting itself is fairly generic, to allow for a wider birth of ideas that you want to bring.

#### Note Taking
Would love a designated note taker though this can change each session. You can use Obsidian to do that and link it to other elements within the world.

##### Recap
I would prefer if the notetaker would do a recap based on the last session's notes, it does not need to be very in-depth.

## House Rules
These are here -> [[House Rules]]


# Campaign
You have each arrived at a local carnival just outside a town called [[Riverrun]], in the middle of West Laylan. 

Perhaps you're just passing through, perhaps you're here for a reason. Perhaps the reason you adventure happens in the first session, that could be fun.
- You have a contact within the town


## Vibe
Hoping to do something akin to a JRPG in scope, less complicated since the mechanics of Dnd bring that itself. Story will be the main driving force.
- There may be moments of story that you get to see even though your characters aren't there

Less frequent and more important fight sequences, sometimes a session might run without combat but for the most part when it happens it'll be bigger, unless it's more of an unscripted one.
- This will give me more time to prep good combats with opportunities and terrain for you to use your characters
- Also in reflection of the new House rules about death saves and stabilising. 

## Characters
Use this -> [[Character Creation Helper]]

##### Ideas
Here are some world prompters, things or events within the world that you'd might have to do some searching
- Spellplague
- Solosian Empire
- Any of the wars or world events that might have remnants from lasting issues
- Different planes

##### Races
Each of the races I customised are only that, if you want to use the original you can. I attempted to give each race their own racial plotline that you can choose to use or not.

**One standard magic item and then one personal, unique one (something integrated with your backstory)**


### Level
Create two lvl 10 characters as well as lvl 20 versions of each so you know where you're going.
- Include spells
- Include levelling path

	This is so we know we're you are heading and it will help me plan accordingly

	The reason we're doing two is so that we can develop both and you can decide which one you'd like to play after a bit of development. Also means you have a backup if anything happens.

### Stats
You can roll or just choose stats that are appropriate for your character, I trust you to not go overboard

### Backgrounds
We've been using backgrounds mostly as flavour and to gain some bonus proficiencies but I'd love to take a deeper dive into it.

This would mean a little more work for everyone because we will have to create those NPCs and connections. 
- Happy to scrap because more work but it'd integrate your characters more into the world.


### Hero Forge
Make a character for it on heroforge 2.0. I will endeavour to make more terrain and maps that we can use it for.
