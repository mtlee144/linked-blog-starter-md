#CampaignOne 
### History Lesson
[[Kingdom of Ix'al]]


### Character One Submission
Remember, what reason is your character in the middle of West Laylan, attending or just walking through a travelling circus that has come to Riverrun.
- I'd love to chat to you and concoct your 'opening sequence' together


### Next Session
 - have at second completed character with sheet

A good snapshot of backstory, Knives, Spoons, Forks, lvl 20 version (including spells), magic items (personal and standard), appearance, background, NPCs etc

#### Making a choice
Which character will you begin with?


#### Timeline to Start
4th November - Second completed Character and decision on which one you'll commit to as your 'Character One'
- I have a wedding
- Stanley can't do night

We could not meet or we do it another date?

Also need to figure out consistent starting time when campaign begins (initially dinner at 5, session 7-10)



# Next Session Locked in
11th November - have second character. Start every two weeks from then
