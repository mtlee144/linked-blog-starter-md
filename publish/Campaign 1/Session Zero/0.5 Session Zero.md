#CampaignOne 

## Character Two Submission
Let's pick which one you'll commit to for the beginning

### Ironing out the details
We've done all the main bits but there are a couple things to finish. We'll spend time running through the [[Character Creation Helper]], making sure you can answer the questions especially the bottom [[Character Creation Helper#Class Questions|Class Questions]]

#### Running through Riverrun
Let's expand and explain why you're there
- Passing through is fine because I'll try to do something to 'form the unlikely party'

We can do some 1-1 workshops to concoct an opening scene/script


#### Magic Items/Abilities/NPCs
We have the ideas but need to translate into DnD terms so that they function properly


#### Memories
At least 3 memories, something that you'd like to show the party as 'story telling elements' in dying moments:

-   What memories does your character have that they hold dear?
-   Is there a memory that your character regrets, be it sad or angry
-   A joyful memoryÂ 
-   A moment from their backstory that is yet to be shared


#### Appearance
I would love an image of what they look like - a vision board would be even better (a set of images that give the vibe - often used for artists as inspiration for their original piece)


## Next Session
25th November - Redo of this session (finalization)
