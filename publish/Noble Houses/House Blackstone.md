#Noble 
A house awarded nobility in the year 984PD in conjunction with [[House Veridian]].

### Heir
The current heir is the product of a joint marriage between a member of the Paradian family and the rulers of Blackstone. Karan Blackstone, a dwarven Forge Cleric.

### Ideals
They, much like the Betrayer Gods, believe that nurturing everybody would eventually lead them to destruction. This doesnâ€™t mean that they leave those who are in need, but rather care well for the poor and unwell.

### Coat of Arms
The symbol of their faction is an onyx colour, with the silhouette of a hammer striking an anvil in front of the Paradian Circle of Unity. As with others united by this Circle the flag is in the style of a stained glass window.

### Location
[[Blackstone Legion]] - East Laylan


### Ancestral Heirloom
