#Noble 
A dwarven house at the very bottom of West Laylan, that received nobility reluctantly as an embassy for the [[Dwarves]]. They specialise in a magical fishing and underwater mining where magical axes are thrown deep and come back with fish. 

They were initially given it in 1732PD at the 750 year anniversary of the [[Paradian Empire]] but refuse to give a response of acceptance or denial. In 1740PD, Thronmin Deepaxe makes an official statement, begrudgingly, that they will be recognised as a noble house of the [[Paradian Empire]].

### Heir
Thronmin Deepaxe is their 28th Heir

### Ideals
“I didn’t want this dag gum nobleship, I just wanted to fish”

### Coat of Arms
An anchor with a fishing line and hook coming off one side on a deep blue background

### Location
On the left hand side of East Laylan, positioned next to Aether Reef

### Ancestral Heirloom
The Deepaxe - A large anchor-like axe that returns to the thrower in a wide arc. It moves quicker in water than on land.
