A renowned family of [[Feywild|Aurlie]] Eladrin, most notably because all their females remain in their Autumn form from the age of 18. Peaceful and good willed they make perfect wives and mothers for many and as such are married off as soon as they come of age. 

It is common belief that these Lockefall Eladrin are unable to change form even if they wanted to.
