#Noble 
A house awarded nobility in the year 984PD in conjunction with [[House Blackstone]].

### Heir
The current heir is the product of a joint marriage between a member of the Paradian family and the rulers of Veridian. Olocan Veridian, a firbolg druid.

### Ideals
They, much like the Cultivator Deities, believe that to nurture others will undoubtedly lead to this same generosity to oneself. This doesnâ€™t mean that they are not willing to fight, but rather sometimes hard truths are what an individual needs to grow and if this means combat then so be it.

### Coat of Arms
The symbol of this faction is a green emblem, with the silhouette of a deer in front of the Paradian Circle of Unity. As with others united by this Circle the flag is in the style of a stained glass window.

### Location
[[Veridian Enclave|The Spire]] - West Laylan


### Ancestral Heirloom
